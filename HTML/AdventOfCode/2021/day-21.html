<h2><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/21">Challenge</a></h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>In todays challenge, we are going to play a game. We have two
players, and a circular track with 10 positions, marked <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>.
Since the track is circular, <code>1</code> follows <code>10</code>.
Each player has a pawn, starting at a random location (which will
be our input), and a score of <code>0</code>.
Players take turns (starting with player 1). During each turn, a
player rolls a die three times, advances their pawn as many
positions as the sum of those rolls, and adds the score their pawn
finishes up on to their score.</p>

<p>So, if a player stands on position <code>7</code> and rolls <code>6</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, she
advances to position <code>2</code>, adding <code>2</code> to her score.</p>
</div>

<h4>Part One</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>For the first game, we are going to use a deterministic <code>100</code> sided die.
The die will roll <code>1</code> on the first roll, <code>2</code> on the second, <code>3</code> on the third,
etc. Once it has rolled <code>100</code> times, it starts over again with a roll of <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The game ends once a player has a score of <code>1000</code> or more.</p>

<p>We are asked to calculate the product of the number of rolls until
the game ends, and the score of the <em>losing</em> player.</p>

<p>With starting positions of <code>4</code> and <code>8</code> for player 1 and player 2,
the game ends on turn <code>331</code>, with player 1 having a score of <code>1000</code>.
The die has been rolled <code>993</code> times, and player 2 has a score of <code>745</code>.
So, the answer would then be <span class = "answer">739785</span>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Part Two</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>In the second game, we swap the deterministic die with a three sided
<em>Dirac die</em>. Rolling a Dirac die causes the universe to split into
multiple copies: one for each possible outcome of the die (so, in this
case, the universe splits into three different universes on each roll).</p>

<p>The game now ends when a player reaches a score of <code>21</code>. We're asked to
find the player which wins in the most universes, and report in how
many universes that player wins.</p>

<p>With the starting positions of <code>4</code> and <code>8</code>, player 1 wins in
<code>444356092776315</code> universes, and player 2 wins in <code>341960390180808</code>
universes. So, we would report <span class = "answer">444356092776315</span>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Reading the input is trivial, it's just two lines where we need the
number at the end of each line:</p>

<pre><code>my @start = map {/([0-9]+)$/} &lt;&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p><code>$start [0]</code> will be the starting position of the first player, and
<code>$start [1]</code> will be the starting position of the second player.</p>

<p>We start off with a helper method, <code>move</code>. It gets the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$positions</code>: an arrayref with the current positions of the two players.</li>
<li><code>$scores</code>: an arrayref with the current scores of the two players.</li>
<li><code>$player</code>: the player whose turn it is (either <code>0</code> for the first player,
or <code>1</code> for the second player)</li>
<li><code>@rolls</code> a list of die rolls made in this turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>The method will update the position and score:</p>

<pre><code>sub move ($positions, $scores, $player, @rolls) {
    $$positions [$player]  += $_ for @rolls;
    $$positions [$player]  %= 10;
    $$positions [$player] ||= 10;
    $$scores    [$player]  += $$positions [$player];
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Part One</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>To calculate the result of Part One, we use a method <code>part_one</code>, which
as argument gets the list of starting positions of the two players.</p>

<p>We start off with some initializations:</p>

<pre><code>sub part_one (@position) {
    my @score  = (0, 0);       # Scores of each player
    my @rolls  = (1 .. 100);   # Initial set of rolls
    my $rolls  = 0;            # Roll count

    my $player = 0;            # Player whose turn it is
</code></pre>

<p>We then start a bare block, which we will use as an infinite loop (due to
a <code>redo</code> at the bottom of the loop):</p>

<pre><code>    {
        ... loop body ...

        redo;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In the loop body, we first move the current player, and adjust their
score. For that, we need
the next three rolls from <code>@rolls</code>, which we will <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc#splice"><code>splice</code></a> off.
We will also adjust the roll count:</p>

<pre><code>move \@position, \@score, $player, splice @rolls =&gt; 0, 3;
$rolls += 3;
</code></pre>

<p>If the current player now has a score of at least <code>1000</code>, the game ends,
and we exit the loop:</p>

<pre><code>last if $score [$player] &gt;= 1000;
</code></pre>

<p>If we have less than three rolls left in <code>@rolls</code>, we add another 100:</p>

<pre><code>push @rolls =&gt; (1 .. 100) if @rolls &lt; 3;
</code></pre>

<p>As last action in the body of the loop, we make the other player the
current player:</p>

<pre><code>$player = 1 - $player;
</code></pre>

<p>Once we have exited the loop (due to the game ending), we can calculate
the required results. <code>$player</code> is the winning player, so the losing
player is <code>$player - 1</code>. Which gives the following return statement:</p>

<pre><code>return $score [1 - $player] * $rolls;
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the method, and printing the result:</p>

<pre><code>say "Solution 1: ", part_one @start;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Part Two</h4>

<p>For Part Two, we will first investigate the possible results of rolling
three <code>3</code> sided dice, and how frequent the result occurs:</p>

<table>
  <tr class = 'row-0' markdown = '1'>
    <th class = 'cell-0-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>Roll</td>
    <th class = 'cell-0-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>Frequency</td>
    <th class = 'cell-0-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'>Possible rolls</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-1' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-1-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>3</td>
    <td class = 'cell-1-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>1</td>
    <td class = 'cell-1-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(1, 1, 1)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-2' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-2-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>4</td>
    <td class = 'cell-2-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>3</td>
    <td class = 'cell-2-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(2, 1, 1)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-3' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-3-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>5</td>
    <td class = 'cell-3-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>6</td>
    <td class = 'cell-3-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(3, 1, 1)</code>, <code>(2, 2, 1)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-4' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-4-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>6</td>
    <td class = 'cell-4-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>7</td>
    <td class = 'cell-4-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(3, 2, 1)</code>, <code>(2, 2, 2)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-5' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-5-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>7</td>
    <td class = 'cell-5-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>6</td>
    <td class = 'cell-5-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(3, 3, 1)</code>, <code>(3, 2, 2)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-6' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-6-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>8</td>
    <td class = 'cell-6-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>3</td>
    <td class = 'cell-6-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(3, 3, 2)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class = 'row-7' markdown = '1'>
    <td class = 'cell-7-0 col-0 ' markdown = '1'>9</td>
    <td class = 'cell-7-1 col-1 ' markdown = '1'>1</td>
    <td class = 'cell-7-2 col-2 ' markdown = '1'><code>(3, 3, 3)</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Part two, we will solve with a recursive subroutine. This gets five
arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$position0</code>, <code>$position1</code>, the current positions of the players.</li>
<li><code>$score0</code>, <code>$score1</code>, the current scores of the players. If not given,
the scores are assumed to be <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>$player</code>, the player whose turn it is. </li>
</ul>

<p>The subroutine will return a 2 element array, with the first element
the number of universes in which the first player wins, and the
second element the number of universes the second player wins.</p>

<p>We will cache results, so we won't repeatedly calculate the same results:</p>

<pre><code>sub part_two ($position0, $position1, $score0 = 0, $score1 = 0, $player = 0) {
    state $cache;
    $$cache {$position0, $position1, $score0, $score1, $player} //= do {
        my $out;
        ... body ...
        $out;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the section marked <code>body</code>, we first check if either player has won:</p>

<pre><code>        $out = [1, 0] if $score0 &gt;= 21;
        $out = [0, 1] if $score1 &gt;= 21;
</code></pre>

<p>If not, we will recurse with each possible outcome of the three die rolls,
multiply the result with the frequency of each of the rolls, and summing
all the results:</p>

<pre><code>        if (!$out) {
            $out = [0, 0];
            foreach my $roll ([3, 1], [4, 3], [5, 6], [6, 7],
                              [7, 6], [8, 3], [9, 1]) {
                my ($roll, $frequency)  = @$roll;

                #
                # Move the current player according to the roll
                #
                my @position = ($position0, $position1);
                my @score    = ($score0,    $score1);
                move \@position, \@score, $player, $roll;

                #
                # And recurse
                #
                my $results = part_two (@position, @score, 1 - $player);

                #
                # Sum results
                #
                $$out [$_] += $$results [$_] * $frequency for 0, 1;
            }
        } 
</code></pre>

<p>We can now call the subroutine, and report the maximum of the two
returned values:</p>

<pre><code>use List::Util qw [max];

say "Solution 2: ", max @{part_two @start};
</code></pre>
