<h2><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6">Challenge</a></h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>We have to deal with fast spawning fish, and we have to model
their growth rate.</p>

<p>We know a new lantarnfish creates a new lanternfish every 7 days.
With the exception of freshly spawned lantarnfish &mdash; they
spawn their first new fish after 9 days (and then a new fish
every 7 days).</p>

<p>But not all fish are on the part of their cycle: while one
lantarnfish may have 4 days left before it spawns another
fish, another lantarnfish may spawn one 2 days from now.</p>

<p>What we are given is a list of numbers, each number is the
number of days left for a particular fish before it spawns
another one.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose we are given the following list:</p>

<pre><code>3,4,3,1,2
</code></pre>

<p>This means we start with five fish. The first and third fish will spawn
three days from now; the second fish four days from now, the fourth
fish tomorrow, and the fifth fish two days from now.</p>

<p>Simulating this over the next 18 days, we get:</p>

<pre><code>Initial state: 3,4,3,1,2
After  1 day:  2,3,2,0,1
After  2 days: 1,2,1,6,0,8
After  3 days: 0,1,0,5,6,7,8
After  4 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,7,8,8
After  5 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,7,7,8
After  6 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,7
After  7 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6
After  8 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5
After  9 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,8
After 10 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,7,8
After 11 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,7,8,8,8
After 12 days: 5,6,5,3,4,5,6,0,0,1,5,6,7,7,7,8,8
After 13 days: 4,5,4,2,3,4,5,6,6,0,4,5,6,6,6,7,7,8,8
After 14 days: 3,4,3,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,7,7,8
After 15 days: 2,3,2,0,1,2,3,4,4,5,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7
After 16 days: 1,2,1,6,0,1,2,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,8
After 17 days: 0,1,0,5,6,0,1,2,2,3,0,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,7,8
After 18 days: 6,0,6,4,5,6,0,1,1,2,6,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,6,7,8,8,8,8
</code></pre>

<p>Given this list, after 18 days we have 26 fish; after 80 days,
we will have <span class = "answer">5934</span> fish, and
after 256 days, we have <span class = "answer">26984457539</span>
fish.</p>
</div>

<h4>Part One</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>Given the input, calculate the number of fish on day 80.</p>
</div>

<h4>Part Two</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>Given the input, calculate the number of fish on day 256.</p>
</div>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>It should be obvious both parts are basically the same thing, just with
a larger number. Part One could be solved by modelling each fish
separately, but Advent of Code veterans would see Part Two coming,
where you certainly cannot do this.</p>

<p>What we should realize that each fish only has at most 9 different states.
Either is spawns today, or in one of the next 8 days. And if two fish
are in the same state on a certain day, they will be in the same state
on any subsequent day (the reverse is not true!).</p>

<p>This means, we can group the fish in equivalence classes (based on their
internal timer), and calculate what happens with each class. For that,
we create a vector <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f\)</span>:</p>

<p>\[
    f = \left(\begin{array}{c}t_0 \\ t_1 \\ t_2 \\ t_3 \\ t_4 \\
                              t_5 \\ t_6 \\ t_7 \\ t_8
              \end{array}\right)
\]</p>

<p>where <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(c_n\)</span> is the number of fish which will spawn <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(n\)</span> days from
now.</p>

<p>We can now define the following sequence:</p>

<p>\[
    f_{g+1} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
                  t^g_1 \\
                  t^g_2 \\
                  t^g_3 \\
                  t^g_4 \\
                  t^g_5 \\
                  t^g_6 \\
                  t^g_7 + t^g_0 \\
                  t^g_8 \\
                  t^g_0 \end{array}\right), \; g > 0,
     \qquad\qquad f_0 = 
              \left(\begin{array}{c}
                  t^0_0 \\
                  t^0_1 \\
                  t^0_2 \\
                  t^0_3 \\
                  t^0_4 \\
                  t^0_5 \\
                  t^0_6 \\
                  t^0_7 \\
                  t^0_8 \end{array}\right)
\]</p>

<p>where <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f^g_i\)</span> is element <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(i\)</span> from <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f_g\)</span>.</p>

<p>We can also write this as a matrix transformation:</p>

<p>\[
    f_{g+1} = \left(
        \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
        0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
        0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
        1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
        \end{array}\right) = A \cdot f_g
\]</p>
</div>

<h4>Iteration</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>Starting with <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f_0\)</span>, we can do the transformation the appropriate
number of times, then sum the values in <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f_{80}\)</span> and <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f_{256}\)</span>.</p>
</div>

<h4>Matrix exponentiation</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>We have <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f_g = A^g \cdot f_0\)</span>. So, we can just raise the matrix <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(A\)</span>
to the power <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(g\)</span>, and apply that to <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(f_0\)</span>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>We start off with some initialization, and reading of the input:</p>

<pre><code>my $GENERATIONS1 =  80;
my $GENERATIONS2 = 256;
my $TIMERS       =   9;

my @fish = (0) x $TIMERS;
   $fish [$_] ++ foreach split /,/ =&gt; &lt;&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>$fish [$i]</code> will contain the number of which which will spawn 
<code>$i</code> days from now.</p>
</div>

<h4>Iteration</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>Iterating over the sequence is easy:</p>

<pre><code>for (1 .. $GENERATIONS2) {
    @fish      = @fish [1 .. $TIMERS - 1, 0];
    $fish [6] += $fish [$TIMERS - 1];
    say "Solution 1: ", sum @fish if $_ == $GENERATIONS1;
    say "Solution 2: ", sum @fish if $_ == $GENERATIONS2;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Matrix exponentation</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>To do matrix exponentation, we have to turn the initial number 
of fish into a vector, and define the matrix (which was named <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(A\)</span>
above). So, after reading the data, we do:</p>

<pre><code>my $fish   = Math::Matrix:: -&gt; new (map {[$_ || 0]} @fish);
my $matrix = Math::Matrix:: -&gt; new ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                                    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
                                    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
                                    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we raise <code>$matrix</code> to the number of generations, and apply
it to the <code>$fish</code> vector. <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Matrix"><code>Math::Matrix</code></a> objects are overloaded,
so we can just use <code>**</code> and <code>*</code>. It also has a <code>sum</code> method which
sums the elements of a matrix. The result of <code>sum</code> is another object,
which, if stringified, results in a number with <code>0</code>s after a 
decimal dot, and a newline. So, we remove this before printing.
Hence, we get:</p>

<pre><code>say "Solution 1: ", (($matrix ** $GENERATIONS1 * $fish) -&gt; sum) =~ s/\..*//sr;
say "Solution 2: ", (($matrix ** $GENERATIONS2 * $fish) -&gt; sum) =~ s/\..*//sr;
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Closed form solution</h4>

<p>Given the matrix exponentation, we can easily create a closed form 
solution, by raising the matrix to the appropriate number of times,
and summing the columns. This would lead to (after reading in the data):</p>

<pre><code>say "Solution 1: ",
          1421 * $fish [0] +       1401 * $fish [1] +       1191 * $fish [2] +
          1154 * $fish [3] +       1034 * $fish [4] +        950 * $fish [5] +
           905 * $fish [6] +        779 * $fish [7] +        768 * $fish [8];

say "Solution 2: ",
    6703087164 * $fish [0] + 6206821033 * $fish [1] + 5617089148 * $fish [2] +
    5217223242 * $fish [3] + 4726100874 * $fish [4] + 4368232009 * $fish [5] +
    3989468462 * $fish [6] + 3649885552 * $fish [7] + 3369186778 * $fish [8];
