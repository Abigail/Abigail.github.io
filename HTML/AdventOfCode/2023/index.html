<p>Every year (since 2015) <a href="adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> offers
a set of programming challenges in the month of December. One two
part puzzle each day, starting on the first of December, finishing
on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>In this set of blog posts, we discuss how we solved each day puzzle.</p>

<p>Some people try to solve the puzzle fast, in an attempt to reach
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard"><em>the leaderboard</em></a>. That
is not something that I aspire. If only because the puzzles become
available at 06:00 my time, and I usually do not stay up that late.</p>

<p>I also do not write two programs. I start by writing a program to
solve the first part, then, when solved and the second part is resolved,
I modify the program to solve part two. This often involves rewriting
how I solved the first part. I prefer solutions which only need to 
pass over the input once; no separate passes for each part (but there
can of course be exceptions).</p>

<p>I strive to make my solutions clean, readible and concise. And generic,
that is, they ought to work on any input which satisfies the given problem;
I don't like programs which don't consider cases "because they didn't occur
in my given input".</p>
