<h2><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-121/#TASK2">Challenge</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given a <code>N x N</code> matrix containing the distances between <code>N</code> cities.</p>
  
  <p>Write a script to find a round trip of minimum length visiting all <code>N</code>
  cities exactly once and returning to the start.</p>
  
  <p><strong>BONUS 1: For a given number <code>N</code>, create a random <code>N x N</code> distance
  matrix and find a solution for this matrix.</strong><br>
  <strong>BONUS 2: Find a solution for a random matrix of size <code>15 x 15</code> or
  <code>20 x 20</code>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Matrix: [0, 5, 2, 7]
        [5, 0, 5, 3]
        [3, 1, 0, 6]
        [4, 5, 4, 0]

Output:
        length = 10
        tour = (0 2 1 3 0)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>I don't get the bonus challenges. How are they different from the main
challenge? Is one <code>N</code> different from another <code>N</code>? </p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problem</a> is a famous example of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">NP-complete</a> problem. In fact, the problem
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness">NP-hard</a>.</p>

<p>This means, there are no (known) quick algorithms giving an exact
solution. Using dynamic programming, the best known algorithms run
in time <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(\mathcal{O} (n^2 2^n)\)</span>. No algorithm is known which runs
in <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(\mathcal{o} (2^n)\)</span>.</p>

<p>There are faster heurisitic algorithms known, but they only produce a
result which is, with high probability, close to the best solution.</p>

<p>To keep our solutions reasonbly simple, we will use brute force,
trying all possible paths, and remembering the shortest. This gives
us a running time which is, up to a polynomial factor, <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(\mathcal{O} (n!)\)</span>.</p>
</div>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>Since we want a tour, that is, we have to return to the starting city,
it doesn't matter where we start. We therefore decide to start and end
our tour in the first city.</p>

<p>Hence, we want to find the shortest path from first city to the first city,
with the following conditions: we never visit a city twice, and we visit
all the cities.</p>

<p>Thus, we create a recursive subroutine (<code>shortest_path</code>) which takes
four arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>The matrix with the distances between the cities</li>
<li>The city we're starting from (<code>from</code>)</li>
<li>The destination city (<code>to</code>)</li>
<li>A set of cities to exclude (<code>exclude</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, the set of excluded cities is empty.</p>

<p>We will return two values: the length of the shortest path, and the
shortest path itself.</p>

<p>If we have already visited all the other cities, (that is, <code>excluded</code>
contains all the cities, except <code>to</code>), there is only
one possible path (from <code>from</code> to <code>to</code>), and
we return its length, and the one-step path.</p>

<p>Otherwise, for all cities <code>next</code> which aren't <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, or in <code>exclude</code>
we call <code>shortest_path</code> with the matrix, <code>next</code> as the starting city,
<code>to</code> as the destination city, and an exclude set consisting for <code>exclude</code>
with <code>from</code> added to it. To the result of each call, we add the distance
between <code>from</code> and <code>next</code>, and remember the minimum value. </p>

<p>This minimum value will be the result of <code>shortest_path</code>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<pre><code>sub shortest_path ($matrix, $from, $to, $exclude) {
    say "shortest_path (matrix, $from, $to, exclude)";
    if (1 + keys %$exclude == @$matrix) {
        # 
        # We have excluded everything, except the destination.
        # This makes it the only, and hence, shortest path.
        #
        return ($$matrix [$from] [$to], [$to]);
    }

    # 
    # Else, try each node other than $from, $to, and what's in $exclude,
    # as the first step. Then recurse, and return the shortest.
    #
    my $shortest = ~0;
    my @shortest_path;
    my %new_exclude = (%$exclude, $from =&gt; 1);
    foreach my $next (0 .. @$matrix - 1) {
        next if $next == $from || $next == $to || $$exclude {$next};
        my ($length, $path) = shortest_path ($matrix, $next, $to,
                                            \%new_exclude);
        say "$next -&gt; $to ==&gt; $length";
        if ($shortest &gt; $length + $$matrix [$from] [$next]) {
            $shortest = $length + $$matrix [$from] [$next];
            @shortest_path = ($next, @$path);
        }  
    }
    return $shortest, \@shortest_path;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Reading in the data, calling <code>shortest_path</code>, and printing the results:</p>

<pre><code>my @matrix = map {[split]} &lt;&gt;;

my  ($length, $path) = shortest_path \@matrix, 0, 0, {};
say "$length\n0 @$path";
</code></pre>
