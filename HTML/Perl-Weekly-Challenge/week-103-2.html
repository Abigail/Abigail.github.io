<h2><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-103/#TASK1">Challenge</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working from home, you decided that on occasion you wanted some
  background noise while working. You threw together a network streamer
  to continuously loop through the files and launched it in a tmux
  (or screen) session, giving it a directory tree of files to play.
  During the day, you connected an audio player to the stream, listening
  through the workday, closing it when done.</p>
  
  <p>For weeks you connect to the stream daily, slowly noticing a gradual
  drift of the media. After several weeks, you take vacation. When
  you return, you are pleasantly surprised to find the streamer still
  running. Before connecting, however, if you consider the puzzle of
  determining which track is playing.</p>
  
  <p>After looking at a few modules to read info regarding the media, a
  quick bit of coding gave you a file list. The file list is in a
  simple CSV format, each line containing two fields: the first the
  number of milliseconds in length, the latter the media'a title (this
  example is of several episodes available from the MercuryTheatre.info):</p>

<pre><code>1709363,"Les Miserables Episode 1: The Bishop (broadcast date: 1937-07-23)"
1723781,"Les Miserables Episode 2: Javert (broadcast date: 1937-07-30)"
1723781,"Les Miserables Episode 3: The Trial (broadcast date: 1937-08-06)"
1678356,"Les Miserables Episode 4: Cosette (broadcast date: 1937-08-13)"
1646043,"Les Miserables Episode 5: The Grave (broadcast date: 1937-08-20)"
1714640,"Les Miserables Episode 6: The Barricade (broadcast date: 1937-08-27)"
1714640,"Les Miserables Episode 7: Conclusion (broadcast date: 1937-09-03)"
</code></pre>
  
  <p>For this script, you can assume to be provided the following information:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the value of <code>$^T</code> (<code>$BASETIME</code>) of the streamer script,</li>
  <li>the value of <code>time()</code>, and</li>
  <li>a CSV file containing the media to play consisting of the length
  in milliseconds and an identifier for the media (title, filename, or other).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Write a program to output which file is currently playing. For purposes
  of this script, you may assume gapless playback, and format the output
  as you see fit.</p>
  
  <p>Optional: Also display the current position in the media as a time-like value.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Example</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Input: 3 command line parameters: start time, current time, file name

    # starttime
    1606134123

    # currenttime
    1614591276

    # filelist.csv

Output:

    "Les Miserables Episode 1: The Bishop (broadcast date: 1937-07-23)"
    00:10:24
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>We have to be careful here. The given start time, and current time
are given in <em>seconds</em>, while the duration periods are given in
<em>milli seconds</em>. We will therefore multiply the start time and
current time (or rather, the difference between them) by <code>1000</code>,
so we can do all the calculations using integers. (We need 64 bit
integers &mdash; in the given example, the holiday lasted for almost 14
weeks; 5 weeks in milliseconds just fit a 32-bit integer).</p>

<p>We will take input from standard input, assuming lines with three
values (a start time, a current time, and a file name) on each line;
values separated by white space. (We also assume the file name does
not contain white space).</p>

<p>We will read the content of the given array; the track info will
be put into an array (both the run time of the track, and its title
as separate entries). We will also sum the track lengths &mdash; this
sum is the time it takes to play the full play list (<code>total_time</code>).</p>

<p>Subtracting the start time from the current time gives us the time
passed since we started (<code>time_diff</code>). We're not interested in the
complete loops, so we mod <code>time_diff</code> with <code>total_time</code>, giving us
the number of milliseconds passed since the last time the play list
was started from the top.</p>

<p>We can now iterate over the array. If the track length is larger
than <code>time_diff</code>, this is the track currently playing. We then print
the track and current position, and we're done. Else, we subtract
the track length from <code>time_diff</code>, and check the next track.</p>
</div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<p>Reading the input, and calculating the time difference in milli-seconds:</p>

<pre><code>open my $fh, "&lt;", $file_name or die "open '$file_name': $!";
my @tracks;
my $total_time = 0;  # Total time to play the entire set of tracks;
                     # in milliseconds.
while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
    my ($play_time, $title) = split /\s*,\s*/ =&gt; $_, 2;
    push @tracks =&gt; [$play_time =&gt; $title];
    $total_time += $play_time;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ignore the playing of the full loops:</p>

<pre><code>$time_diff %= $total_time;
</code></pre>

<p>Finding the right track, and printing the results. Note that we
print the position in seconds, so we have to divide <code>$time_diff</code>
by <code>1000</code>. We also want integer division in this sections, hence
the use of <code>use integer</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $track (@tracks) {
    if ($time_diff - $$track [0] &lt; 0) {
        use integer;
        $time_diff    =  $time_diff / 1000;  # Back to seconds.
        my $hours     =  $time_diff / 3600;
        my $minutes   = ($time_diff % 3600) / 60;
        my $seconds   = ($time_diff         % 60);
        say $$track [1],
            sprintf ("%02d:%02d:%02d" =&gt; $hours, $minutes, $seconds) =~
                    s/^00://r;  # Remove leading '00:' for track
                                # shorter than an hour.
        last;
    }
    $time_diff -= $$track [0];
}
