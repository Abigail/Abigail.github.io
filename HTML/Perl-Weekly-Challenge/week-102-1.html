<h2>Discussion</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>If we follow the <a href="http://www.shyamsundergupta.com/rare.htm">given link</a>,
it turns out that a rare number is a number <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(r\)</span> such that \(r +
r_v\) and <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(r - r_v\)</span> are perfect squares, where <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(r_v\)</span> is constructed
from <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(r\)</span> by reversing its digits. Furthermore, <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(r\)</span> should not
be a palindrome.</p>

<p>At first glance this looks like an easy exercise; just take all
numbers of a specific size, and for each of them, reverse it, take
the sum and difference of the original and reversal, and see whether
they are perfect square.</p>

<p>But that quickly becomes unwieldy; this is exponential in <code>N</code>, where
<code>N</code> is the given size. As Shyam (the person who named and studied
rare numbers)
<a href="https://www.primepuzzles.net/conjectures/conj_023.htm">writes</a>:
<em>I have developed a computer program in Fortran to calculate Rare
numbers. In fact with refinement of the code over the years, the
program has been made so powerful that all numbers up to <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(10^{14}\)</span>
can be just checked for Rare numbers in less than a minute on Pentium
III PC. In few hours I have been able to check up to <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(10^{18}\)</span>.</em></p>

<p><a href="https://science.ucalgary.ca/mathematics-statistics/about/richard-guy">Richard
Guy</a>
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325149?seq=1">writes</a>: <em>Here are
three problems that have come to light recently, each of which can
consume unlimited amounts of computer time, perhaps without revealing
anything significant</em>. One of those three problems is the problem
of finding Rare Numbers. (The article is behind a pay wall, but the
relevant quote can be seen on the free preview).</p>

<p>Now, modern computers are faster than a Pentium III, but this shows
that doing the actual calculations for a Perl Weekly Challenge seems
excessive.</p>

<p>The rare numbers are (of course) found on the <a href="oeis.org">On-Line Encyclopedia
of Integer Sequences</a>Â®; as sequence
<a href="https://oeis.org/A035519">A035519</a>. It does show code to check
whether a number is a Rare Number, but it doesn't have code to
efficiently calculate the Rare Numbers. But it has a <a href="https://oeis.org/A035519/b035519.txt">list of all
known Rare Numbers</a>. And it
turns out, only 124 Rare Numbers are known, all of length 22 or
less. And this gives us a way of doing the challenge efficiently.</p>
</div>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>One way of attacking the challenge by including the list of known
Rare Numbers, and checking the length all the numbers with the given
input.</p>

<p>But since we have the list of numbers, we can do a bit of preprocessing.
We can take all the known Rare Numbers, group them by size, join
Rare Numbers of the same length by newlines, and put the resulting
numbers in an array, indexed by length of the Rare Numbers. Then
the resulting program includes this array, and just prints the
corresponding entry (if any).</p>

<p>And we can do this for all languages (except BASIC) we solve the
challenge with.</p>
</div>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>We're reading the data from <a href="https://oeis.org/A035519/b035519.txt">the list of
numbers</a> we found at the
<a href="https://oeis.org">OEIS</a>. This list consists of lines, each line
having an index number (which we will ignore), and a Rare Number.
We have this list available in a file called
<a href="https://github.com/Abigail/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-102/abigail/data/rare_numbers.txt"><code>rare_numbers.txt</code></a>.</p>

<p>We start off by reading in the numbers, and putting them in buckets,
so all numbers of the same length are in the same bucket:</p>

<pre><code>open my $fh, "&lt;", "rare_numbers.txt" or die "open rare_numbers.txt: $!";

my @buckets;

while (my $rn = &lt;$fh&gt;) {
    chomp $rn;
    $rn =~ s/^[0-9]+\s+//;
    push @{$buckets [length $rn]} =&gt; $rn;
}   

my @bs = sort {$a &lt;=&gt; $b} grep {$buckets [$_]} keys @buckets;
</code></pre>

<p>Now <code>@buckets</code> will have the buckets (each bucket an array of numbers (as strings)), and <code>@bs</code> will contain the indices of the non-empty buckets.</p>

<p>We now open a file for each of the languages we're solving this challenge in:</p>

<pre><code>open my $awk_h,    "&gt;", "rn.awk"   or die "open rn.awk: $!";  
open my $bash_h,   "&gt;", "rn.sh"    or die "open rn.sh: $!";
open my $basic_h,  "&gt;", "rn.bas"   or die "open rn.bas: $!";
open my $c_h,      "&gt;", "rn.c"     or die "open rn.c: $!";
open my $lua_h,    "&gt;", "rn.lua"   or die "open rn.lua: $!";
open my $node_h,   "&gt;", "rn.js"    or die "open rn.js: $!";
open my $perl_h,   "&gt;", "rn.pl"    or die "open rn.pl: $!";
open my $python_h, "&gt;", "rn.py"    or die "open rn.py: $!";
open my $ruby_h,   "&gt;", "rn.rb"    or die "open rn.rb: $!";
</code></pre>

<p>We then start off with writing some code declaring arrays:</p>

<pre><code>my  $basic_ln = 1000;

say $awk_h      "BEGIN {";
say $bash_h     "declare -a rare_numbers\n";
say $basic_h    "$basic_ln INPUT length\n\n";
say $c_h        "char * rare_numbers [23];\n";
say $c_h        "int main () {";
say $lua_h      "rare_numbers = {}\n";
say $node_h     "let rare_numbers = []\n";
say $perl_h     "my \@rare_numbers;\n";
say $python_h   "rare_numbers = {}\n";
say $ruby_h     "rare_numbers = Array . new";
</code></pre>

<p>We will now iterate over the buckets, and add write code populating the <code>rare_numbers</code> arrays. If there are multiple Rare Numbers of the same length, we concatenate several strings. Some languages have a concatenate operator (Lua, Node.js, Perl, Python, Ruby), others juxtaposition (AWK, Bash, C).</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $bs (0 .. 22) {
    if (!$buckets [$bs]) {
        printf $c_h "    rare_numbers [%2d] =                       NULL;\n"
                    =&gt; $bs;
        next;
    }   

    #
    # AWK
    #    
    printf $awk_h  '    rare_numbers [%2d] = ', $bs;
    print  $awk_h  join " \\\n                        " =&gt;

    print  $bash_h "\n";

    #
    # BASIC
    # 
    for my $rn (@{$buckets [$bs]}) {
        printf $basic_h qq "%03d IF length = %2d THEN PRINT %24s\n"
                     =&gt;    ($basic_ln += 10), $bs, qq {"$rn"}

    print  $c_h    ";\n";

    #

    #    
    printf $lua_h  "rare_numbers [%2d] = ", $bs;
    print  $lua_h  join " ..\n                    " =&gt;
                   map {sprintf "%26s", qq {"$_\\n"}} @{$buckets [$bs]};
    print  $lua_h "\n";

    #
    # Node.js
    #   
    printf $node_h "rare_numbers [%2d] = ", $bs;
    print  $node_h join " +\n                    " =&gt;
                   map {sprintf "%26s", qq {"$_\\n"}} @{$buckets [$bs]};
    print  $node_h "\n";

    #
    # Perl
    #              
    printf $perl_h '$rare_numbers [%2d] = ', $bs;
    print  $perl_h join " .\n                     " =&gt;
                   map {sprintf "%26s", qq {"$_\\n"}} @{$buckets [$bs]};
    say    $perl_h ";";

    #
    # Python
    #              
    printf $python_h "rare_numbers [%4s] =", "'$bs'";
    print  $python_h join " +\\\n                     " =&gt;
                     map {sprintf "%26s", qq {"$_\\n"}} @{$buckets [$bs]};
    print  $python_h "\n";

    #
    # Ruby
    #                
    printf $ruby_h "rare_numbers [%2s] =", $bs;
    print  $ruby_h join " +\n                   " =&gt;
                   map {sprintf "%26s", qq {"$_\\n"}} @{$buckets [$bs]};
    print  $ruby_h "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can now finish off the files, and close them:</p>

<pre><code>say $awk_h "}";
say $c_h   "}";

close $awk_h     or die "close rn.awk: $!";
close $bash_h    or die "close rn.sh: $!";

<p>Once we have the array with the known Rare Numbers, we just read
the require length from standard input, and print the corresponding
entry &mdash; or the empty string if there are no known Rare Numbers of
that length.</p>

<h3>AWK</h3>

<pre><code>BEGIN {
    rare_numbers [ 2] =                     "65\n"

    if ($1 in rare_numbers) {
        printf "%s", rare_numbers [$1]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once we have the array in place (which is done in a <code>BEGIN</code> block),
we read lengths from standard input (which is available in <code>$1</code>).
If we have an entry for that length, we print it.</p>

<h3>Bash</h3>

<pre><code>declare -a rare_numbers

rare_numbers[ 2]="65\n"
rare_numbers[ 6]="621770\n"
rare_numbers[ 9]="281089082\n"
rare_numbers[10]="2022652202\n"\
"2042832002\n"
rare_numbers[12]="868591084757\n"\
"872546974178\n"\
"872568754178\n"

#
# ... More entries ...
#

while read length
do    printf "${rare_numbers[$length]}"
done
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in Bash, unlike in AWK or C, juxtaposition only works if
there are no spaces in between, hence the absence of indentation.
An non-existing entry in an array is equivalent to an empty string,
so we don't need to check for existence.</p>

<h3>BASIC</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Our BASIC solution is very different. We're using a very bare bones
implementation of BASIC
(<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Language::Basic"><code>Language::Basic</code></a>),
and it's easier just to have a bunch of <code>IF</code> statements:</p>

<pre><code>1000 INPUT length
1005 IF length &lt;  0 THEN END

1010 IF length =  2 THEN PRINT                     "65"
1020 IF length =  6 THEN PRINT                 "621770"
1030 IF length =  9 THEN PRINT              "281089082"
1040 IF length = 10 THEN PRINT             "2022652202"
1050 IF length = 10 THEN PRINT             "2042832002"
1060 IF length = 12 THEN PRINT           "868591084757"
1070 IF length = 12 THEN PRINT           "872546974178"
1080 IF length = 12 THEN PRINT           "872568754178"

<h3>C</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>In C, we cannot index outside of an array, or deal with uninitialized
values, so we have <code>NULL</code> values for lengths which don't have Rare
Numbers, and check the input so we don't index outside of the array:</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Something similar in Python as well. But here we're using a dictionary
(which uses strings to index) to store the Rare Numbers, so we can
more easily check whether there is an entry:</p>

<pre><code>rare_numbers = {}

rare_numbers [ '2'] =                    "65\n"   
rare_numbers [ '6'] =                "621770\n"   
rare_numbers [ '9'] =             "281089082\n"   
rare_numbers ['10'] =            "2022652202\n" +\
                                 "2042832002\n"   
rare_numbers ['12'] =          "868591084757\n" +\
                               "872546974178\n" +\
                               "872568754178\n"
#
# ... More entries ...
#

for l in fileinput . input ():
    l = l . strip ()
    if l in rare_numbers:
        sys . stdout . write (rare_numbers [l])

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>And the solution in Ruby is similar as well, using <code>+</code> to concatenate
strings, and the <code>to_i</code> method to convert a string to an integer:</p>

<pre><code>rare_numbers = Array . new

rare_numbers [ 2] =                    "65\n"  
rare_numbers [ 6] =                "621770\n"  
rare_numbers [ 9] =             "281089082\n"  
rare_numbers [10] =            "2022652202\n" +
                               "2042832002\n"  
rare_numbers [12] =          "868591084757\n" +
                             "872546974178\n" +
                             "872568754178\n"
#
# ... More entries ...
#
ARGF . each_line do |length|
    print rare_numbers [length . to_i]
end
