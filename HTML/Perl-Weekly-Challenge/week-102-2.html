<h2><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-102/#TASK2">Challenge</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given a positive integer <code>$N</code>.</p>
  
  <p>Write a script to produce Hash-counting string of that length.</p>
  
  <p>The definition of a hash-counting string is as follows:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the string consists only of digits 0-9 and hashes, <code>#</code></li>
  <li>there are no two consecutive hashes: <code>##</code> does not appear in your string</li>
  <li>the last character is a hash</li>
  <li>the number immediately preceding each hash (if it exists) is the position
  of that hash in the string, with the position being counted up from 1</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>It can be shown that for every positive integer <code>N</code> there is exactly
  one such length-<code>N</code> string.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>(a) "#" is the counting string of length 1
(b) "2#" is the counting string of length 2
(c) "#3#" is the string of length 3
(d) "#3#5#7#10#" is the string of length 10
(e) "2#4#6#8#11#14#" is the string of length 14
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>We can solve this problem easily be working backwards, repeatedly
putting a <code>#</code> and a number, until we have filled the entire string
(the resulting string may start with a <code>#</code>, or a number).</p>

<p>We will use an array to keep track of what we have calculated what
goes in the string; if we're done, we print the content of the array
in reverse.</p>

<p>We will assume standard input contains the lengths (one length per
line of input) of the strings we need to print.</p>
</div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<pre><code>while (my $index = &lt;&gt;) {
    chomp $index;
    my @out;
    my $hash = 0;
    while ($index) {
        if ($hash = !$hash) {
            push @out =&gt; "#";
            $index --;
        }
        else {
            push @out =&gt;      $index + 1;
            $index -= length ($index + 1);
        }
    }
    say join "" =&gt; reverse @out;
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>@out</code> contains the pieces we have to construct the resulting string
with. We're using <code>$hash</code> as a boolean indicating whether we going
to add a hash or a number, flipping its truth value on each iteration,
and starting with a hash. <code>$index</code> contains the position of where
the last character of <em>next</em> component will appear in the string
(1-based). The loop terminates if <code>$index</code> is 0.</p>

<p>If we're adding a hash, we subtract <code>1</code> from <code>$index</code>. If we are
adding a number, the number will be one larger than <code>$index</code>, as
that is the position where the next hash will be. We then subtract
the length of <code>$index + 1</code> from <code>$index</code>, as this is the number of
characters the number is going to be using.</p>

<p>Once we have the complete array, we reverse it, and print it.</p>

<h3>AWK</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>The AWK solution is similar to the Perl solution. We use a variable
<code>i</code> to keep track of our position in the array <code>out</code>, as AWK does
not have a <code>push</code> operation. A loop is used to print the resulting
array, as we lack a <code>join</code> operator. The role of <code>$index</code> is played
by the variable <code>idx</code>, as <code>index</code> is a reserved word in AWK.</p>

<pre><code>{
    idx  = $1
    hash = 0
    i    = 0
    while (idx) {
        i ++
        if (hash = !hash) {
            out [i] = "#"
            idx --
        }
        else {   
            out [i] =       idx + 1
            idx  -= length (idx + 1)
        }
    }
    for (; i; i --) {
        printf "%s", out [i]
    }
    printf "\n"
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Bash</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>The Bash solution is similar to the AWK solution. No <code>push</code>, nor a <code>join</code>:</p>

<pre><code>while read index
do    declare -a out
      hash=0
      i=0
      while ((index &gt; 0))
      do    ((i ++))
            if   ((hash = !hash))
            then out[$i]="#"
                 ((index --))
            else number=$((index + 1))
                 out[$i]=$number   
                 ((index -= ${#number}))
            fi
      done
      for ((; i; i --))
      do  printf "%s" ${out[$i]}
      done
      echo
done

<h3>Befunge-93</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Despite looking very different, our Befunge-93 solution uses a
similar algorithm. We don't have variable in Befunge-93, but we do
have a stack. We use this stack to store the <em>characters</em> if the
resulting string, so we have to split any numbers into individual
characters. The reason for this is that if a number is printed,
Befunge-93 will also output a space &mdash; which we do not want.</p>

<p>To keep track of the index, we write keep track of its value in a
cell of the program: cell <code>(1, 1)</code>. This means the program only
works for lengths up to 127, as cells will store signed <code>char</code>s
(which range from <code>-128</code> to <code>127</code>).</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&amp;:1+!#@_11p  &gt;"#" 11g :1-!#v_ 11g1-11p &gt; :55+% 86*+\ 11g1-11p 55+/ :#v_ v
                            $           ^                             &lt;  $
              ^            _v# g11                                       &lt;
^                           &gt;:#v_$ 55+,
                            ^ ,&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>We can break down this program into several parts. First, we read
a number from standard input; if the number is <code>-1</code>, we have reached
the end of the input and we terminate the program. Else, we store
this number in the position <code>(1, 1)</code>. This number will play the
role of the <code>index</code> variable in our other solutions:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&amp;:1+!#@_11p
</code></pre>

<p>We now add an hash to the stack. If the index is <code>1</code>, this is the
last character to be placed, and we go to the printing code (see
later). We have made a copy, so the current index remains on the
stack; this is popped if we go to the printing routine.</p>

<pre><code>"#" 11g :1-!#v_
             $
</code></pre>

<p>If we don't go printing the string yet, we first subtract <code>1</code> from
the index. We do this by fetching the value (which puts it on the
stack), subtract <code>1</code>, and then storing the result back (which removes
it from the stack):</p>

<pre><code>11g1-11p
</code></pre>

<p>Else, we use a loop to split the index (the value before subtracting
is still on top of the stack) into individual characters: we mod
the number with <code>10</code> (<code>55+</code>), add <code>48</code> (<code>86*</code>) to get the ASCII
value, swap the two number on the stack (so the index is on the
top, and the character to be printed just below it); we subtract
<code>1</code> from the stored index (<code>11g1-11p</code>, as above), and divide the
top of the stack (the number we're converting to characters) by
<code>10</code> (<code>55+/</code>). We keep doing that until we have consumed this number:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; :55+% 86*+\ 11g1-11p 55+/ :#v_
^                             &lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Once we've converted the entire number to characters, we check
whether the index has reached <code>0</code>. If so, we go to the printing
routine. Else, we go back to the part where the add a hash, and
continue from there:</p>

<pre><code>                                                           v
                                                           $
^            _v# g11                                       &lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we enter this code fragment at the <code>v</code> on the top right.
If we go to the printing routine, this is at the <code>v</code> on the bottom
row.</p>

<p>Printing is just a matter of printing the stack, until the stack
is empty (that is, there is a <code>0</code> at the top of the stack):</p>

<pre><code>^                           &gt;:#v_$ 55+,
                            ^ ,&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>Code is entered at the <code>ï¹¥</code> on the top row. If it's non-zero, e
print it, and loop back. Else, we pop the resulting <code>0</code>, and print
a newline (ASCII <code>10</code>): <code>55+,</code>. We're then running off the field
to the right, but since we're on a torus, we enter from the left
again, and we're being send up again (<code>^</code>), back to the beginning
of the program.</p>

<h3>C</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>C follows the more or less the same algorithm as AWK and Bash.
Except that we only put numbers into the <code>out</code> array; in C it is
much easier to have arrays all of the same type, and numbers are
easier to deal with than strings. If we want to put a hash into the
array, we put a <code>-1</code> there, and when we're printing out the array,
on encountering a <code>-1</code>, we print a hash:</p>

<pre><code># define MAX_LENGTH 23

int main (void) {
    long long index;
    char tmp [MAX_LENGTH];

    while (scanf ("%lld", &amp;index) &gt; 0) {
        /*
         * Create an array of long longs. (More than we need).
         */
        long long * out;
        if ((out = (long long *) malloc (index * sizeof (long long))) == NULL) {
            perror ("Malloc 'out' failed");
            exit (1);
        }

        bool hash = false;
        size_t i = 0;

        while (index) {
            if ((hash = !hash)) {
                out [i] = -1;
                index --;
            }
            else {  
                out [i] = index + 1;
                sprintf (tmp, "%lld", out [i]);
                index -= strnlen (tmp, MAX_LENGTH);
            }
            i ++;
        }
        for (;i --;) {
            if (out [i] == -1) {
                printf ("#");
            }
            else {
                printf ("%lld", out [i]);
            }
        }
        printf ("\n");

        free (out);
    }
    return (0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We use a string <code>tmp</code> to write a number into (as a string), so we
know how many characters it requires. 22 characters are enough to
store a 64 bit signed integer, hence <code>tmp</code> is a 23 character string
(so we have room for a terminating <code>NUL</code> character.)</p>

<h3>Lua</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Lua follows a similar algorithm as we used is most other languages:</p>

<pre><code>for index in io . lines () do
    index = tonumber (index)
    out = {}
    hash = false
    i = 0
    while index &gt; 0 do
        hash = not hash
        i = i + 1
        if  hash then
            out [i] = "#"
            index = index - 1
        else
            out [i] = index + 1
            index = index - tostring (index + 1) : len ()
        end
    end  
    for j = i, 1, -1 do
        io . write (out [j])
    end
    io . write ("\n")
end
</code></pre>

<h3>Node.js</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>A similar program in Node.js. It has <code>reverse</code> and <code>join</code>, so we
do not have to walk over the array to print it out piecewise:</p>

<pre><code>require ('readline')
. createInterface ({input: process . stdin})
. on ('line', _ =&gt; make_hash (+ _))
;

function make_hash (index) {
    let out = [] 
    let hash = false 
    while (index &gt; 0) {  
        if (hash = !hash) {  
            out . push ("#")
            index --
        }
        else {
            out . push (index + 1)
            index -=   (index + 1) . toString () . length
        }
    }  
    console . log (out . reverse () . join (""))
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Python</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Python has a <code>reverse</code> and a <code>join</code>, but the <code>reverse</code> reverses the
array in place; we can't use its return value. <code>join</code> is a method
to be called on the separator, not on the array.</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput

for index in fileinput . input ():
    index = int (index)
    out = []
    hash = 0
    while index &gt; 0:
        hash = not hash
        if hash:
            out . append ("#")
            index = index - 1
        else:
            out . append (str (index + 1))
            index = index - len (str (index + 1))
    out . reverse ()
    print ("" . join (out))
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Ruby</h3>

<p>The solution in Ruby is very similar to the one in Perl, except
that we need some explicit conversions between strings and integers:</p>

<pre><code>ARGF . each_line do |_|
    index = _ . to_i
    out = Array . new  
    hash = false
    while index &gt; 0 do
        if hash = !hash
            out . push ("#")
            index -= 1
        else
            out . push ((index + 1) . to_s)
            index -=    (index + 1) . to_s . length
        end
    end
    puts (out . reverse . join)
end
</code></pre>
