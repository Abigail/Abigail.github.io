<h2><a href="https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-128/#TASK2">Challenge</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are given two arrays of arrival and departure times of trains
  at a railway station.</p>
  
  <p>Write a script to find out the minimum number of platforms needed
  so that no train needs to wait.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<pre><code>Input: @arrivals   = (11:20, 14:30)
       @departures = (11:50, 15:00)
Output: 1
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The 1st arrival of train is at 11:20 and this is the only train
at the station, so you need 1 platform.</li>
<li>Before the second arrival at 14:30, the first train left the station
at 11:50, so you still need only 1 platform.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<pre><code>Input: @arrivals   = (10:20, 11:00, 11:10, 12:20, 16:20, 19:00)
       @departures = (10:30, 13:20, 12:40, 12:50, 20:20, 21:20)
Output: 3
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Between 12:20 and 12:40, there would be at least 3 trains at the station,
so we need minimum 3 platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>If train A departures at minute X, while train arrives at time X,
A and B cannot use the same platform.</li>
<li>There is no minimum distance between trains (or rather, if there is
a minimum distance, it's less than a minute). That is, if train A
leaves a platform at minute X, train B can arrive at the same platform
at time X + 1.</li>
<li>No two trains can share the same platform &mdash; either the trains are long,
or the platforms short.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>One way of solving this is to take all the arrival and departure times,
sort them, and process them one by one, keeping a running total of
platforms needed. For each arrival, we add one, for each departure,
we subtract one.</p>

<p>But that requires us to sort the arrival and departure times. Using a 
regular sort (as build in in many languages) would require 
<span class = 'latex-inline'>\(\Omega (N \log N)\)</span> time, where <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N\)</span> is the number of arrival and departure
times. Now, given that all the arrival and departure times are from a
fixed sized universe, we can write a custom sorting routine which runs
in linear time.</p>

<p>But we will skip the sorting all together. Instead, we'll create an array
where for every minute of the day, we count the number of trains in the
station. There are only <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(24 \cdot 60 = 1440\)</span> minutes in a day, so creating
the array, and processing a single train can be done in constant time.</p>

<p>For each train, we take the its arrival and departure time, and translate
it to minutes past midnight (<code>hh:mm == 60 * hh + mm</code> minutes after midnight).
This gives us a range of minutes, and we'll add one for each of those minutes
in the given array. When we have processed all trains, we just have find
the maximum in the array when we're done.</p>

<p>It's unclear whether the input may contains departure times which are
before the arrival time &mdash; this would be the case of trains which stay
overnight at the station. We will handle this case, by basically processing
it as two trains: one from midnight till the departure time, and one from
the arrival time till midnight.</p>
</div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>We start off by reading the input: we read a line of arrival times, and
a line of departure times, and extract the times in <code>hh:mm</code> format
from them:</p>

<pre><code>my @arrivals   = map {[split /:/]} &lt;&gt; =~ /[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]/g;
my @departures = map {[split /:/]} &lt;&gt; =~ /[0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9]/g;
</code></pre>

<p>We need an array for each minute, initialized at all <code>0</code>s:</p>

<pre><code>my @trains = (0) x (24 * 60);
</code></pre>

<p>Now we process each train, translating the arrival and departure times
to minutes after midnight. Given those minutes after midnight, we can
find the range of minutes the trains is at the station (special casing
trains which arrive before midnight, and leave after). For each minute
in the range, we increment the counter for that minute:</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $i (keys @arrivals) {
    my $arrival   = 60 * $arrivals   [$i] [0] + $arrivals   [$i] [1];
    my $departure = 60 * $departures [$i] [0] + $departures [$i] [1];
    my @minutes;
    if ($arrival &lt;= $departure) {
        @minutes = $arrival .. $departure;
    }
    else {
        @minutes = (0 .. $departure, $arrival .. (24 * 60 - 1));
    }
    $trains [$_] ++ for @minutes;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we find the maximum number of trains in the station, and print this:</p>

<pre><code>use List::Util qw [max];
say max @trains;
</code></pre>
