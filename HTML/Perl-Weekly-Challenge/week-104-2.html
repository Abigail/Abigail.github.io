<h2><a href="https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-104/#TASK2">Challenge</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a script to simulate the NIM Game.</p>
  
  <p>It is played between 2 players. For the purpose of this task,
  let assume you play against the machine.</p>
  
  <p>There are 3 simple rules to follow:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>You have 12 tokens</li>
  <li>Each player can pick 1, 2 or 3 tokens at a time</li>
  <li>The player who picks the last token wins the game</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> the well known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">Nim</a>
game, which starts with multiple non-empty heaps, and players take
one or more tokens from a single heap (players can take all the
tokens of a heap). The player taking the last token loses.</p>

<p>Wikipedia calls the game described above as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#The_subtraction_game">subtraction
game</a>, and
presents it as a variation of Nim, although it acknowledges that
the game is sometimes also called Nim.</p>

<p>The subtraction game is pretty boring. The second player has a
winning strategy if, and only if, <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N \equiv 0 (\text{mod } k + 1)\)</span>
where <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N\)</span> is the number of tokens the game starts with, and <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(k\)</span>
is the maximum number of tokens one can
take during their turn. In that case, the strategy for the second
player is simple: on each turn, if the second player takes <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(l\)</span> tokens,
the second player takes <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(k + 1 - l\)</span> tokens. By using this strategy, the
second player guarantees that after each of her turns,
<span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N \equiv 0 (\text{mod } k + 1)\)</span>, until <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N = 0\)</span>,
which makes her win the game.</p>

<p>If, at the start of the game, we have <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N \equiv m (\text{mod } k + 1)\)</span>,
for some <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(1 \leq m \leq k\)</span>, the first player has a winning strategy:
in his first move, he takes <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(m\)</span> tokens,
making <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(N \equiv 0 (\text{mod } k + 1)\)</span>.
He then follows the strategy of the second player explained above.</p>

<p>With the given parameters, the game is a win for the second player,
and the second player always wins on the third move.</p></div>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>We will create a simple interactive game. We ask the user how many
tokens she wants to take (lets call this amount <code>t</code>), and then take
(<code>4 - t</code>) tokens ourselves. This leaves <code>8</code> tokens after the first
move, <code>4</code> tokens after the second move, and <code>0</code> after the third move.
At that moment, we declare victory.</p>

<p>If the player enters an invalid move, we don't do anything, and just ask again.</p></div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>We will be using a simple while loop: as long as there are tokens
left, we ask how many tokens the player wants to take &mdash; showing
many tokens are left. We validate the input, and if correct, we
show many tokens the computer takes. We then update the number of
tokens, and repeat.</p>

<pre><code>$| = 1;

my $tokens   = 12;
my $max_take =  3;
while ($tokens &gt; 0) {
    printf "How many tokens do you take? (%2d token%s are left) " =&gt;
                    $tokens, $tokens == 1 ? "" : "s";
    chomp (my $t = &lt;&gt;);
    redo unless $t =~ /^\s*[0-9]+\s*$/ &amp;&amp; 1 &lt;= $t &lt;= $max_take;
    my $takes = $max_take + 1 - $t;
    printf "Computer takes %d token%s\n" =&gt; $takes, $takes == 1 ? "" : "s";
    $tokens -= ($max_take + 1);
}

say "Computer wins";

<h3>AWK</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>The AWK solution is very similar:</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN {

    max_take =  3

    while (tokens &gt; 0) {
        printf "How many tokens do you take? (%2d token%s are left) ", \
                tokens, (tokens == 1 ? "" : "s");
        if ((getline take) &gt; 0) {
            if (1 &lt;= take &amp;&amp; take &lt;= max_take) {
                takes = max_take + 1 - take
                printf "Computer takes %d token%s\n", \
                        takes, (takes == 1 ? "" : "s")
                tokens -= (max_take + 1)
            }
        }
    }

    print "Computer wins"

<h3>BASIC</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>No <code>WHILE</code> in the BASIC dialect we're using, but we have <code>GOTO</code>.
There is no explicit <code>GOTO</code> in the program, but if the <code>THEN</code> part
of an <code>IF</code> statement contains just a number, it's treated as a
<code>GOTO</code>.</p>

<pre><code>1000 LET tokens  = 12
1010 LET maxtake =  3

1110 PRINT "How many tokens do you take? (";
1120 IF tokens &lt; 10 THEN PRINT " ";
1130 PRINT tokens;
1140 PRINT "tokens are left) ";

1210 INPUT ""; take
1220 IF take &lt; 1       THEN 1100
1230 IF take &gt; maxtake THEN 1100

1310 LET takes = maxtake + 1

1320 PRINT "Computer takes ";

<h3>Befunge-93</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Although the code looks very different, we're still following a
similar algorithm as in the solutions above. We do however hard
code the response (on an input of <code>1</code>, we take <code>3</code> tokens; on an
input of <code>2</code>, we take <code>2</code> tokens; on an input of <code>3</code>, we take <code>1</code>
token, on any other number of tokens, we repeat the question). And
we have hardcoded the number of tokens subtracted in each round
(<code>4</code>). When victory has been declared, the program ends at the
bottom right (<code>@</code>).</p>

<pre><code>&lt; v"How many tokens do you take? ("      &lt;    _^#: &lt; *43

<h3>Scheme</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>For our Scheme solution, we're using a recursive method. We're
defining a method <code>play</code>, which take the number of tokens left as
argument. If the number of tokens is 0, it declares victory.
Otherwise, it asks the player how many tokens the player wants to
take, displays the number of tokens the computer it going to take,
and then it calls itself with an updated number of tokens. If the
player inputs an invalid number of tokens, the method just calls
itself with the original number of tokens.</p>
