<blockquote>
  <p>You are given a string of delimiter pairs and a string to search.</p>
  
  <p>Write a script to return two strings, the first with any characters matching the &ldquo;opening character&rdquo; set, the second with any matching the &ldquo;closing character&rdquo; set.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<pre><code>Input:
    Delimiter pairs: ""[]()
    Search String: "I like (parens) and the Apple ][+" they said.

Output:
    "(["
    ")]"
</code></pre>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<pre><code>Input:
    Delimiter pairs: **//&lt;&gt;
    Search String: /* This is a comment (in some languages) */ &lt;could be a tag&gt;

Output:
    /**/&lt;
    /**/&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<div class = "section">
<p>What a strange way to phrase the exercise. The entire "delimiter pairs"
is a red herring. We are not asked to do anything with delimiting pairs.
This is clear from both examples. Take for instance the first example;
the first delimiting pair using <code>"</code> for both the opening delimiter and
the closing delimiter. And the string to search in, uses a single pair
of double quotes as delimiting pair. Yet, the pair appears in both the
output strings.</p>

<p>So, basically we are given a string, and two sets of characters we need
to extract from the string, and for some perverse reason, the two sets
of characters are interleaved. Weird.</p>
</div>

<h3>Perl</h3>

<p>First, we read the input. First line of input are the interleaved sets
of characters to extract - second line of input is the string we want
to search:</p>

<pre><code>chomp (my $chars = &lt;&gt;);
$_ = &lt;&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>We remove the newline from the first line we read; there is no need to
bother to remove it from the second line.</p>

<p>We now extract the characters from <code>$char</code> in the odd and even positions,
giving us two sets of characters. We do this by removing the characters
on the even and odd positions from <code>$char</code>; and since we use the <code>/r</code>
modifier, <code>$char</code> itself is unmodified, and the modified string is
returned. We also escape any slashes in the sets (for reasons which will
soon be clear).</p>

<pre><code>my $odds = $chars =~ s/(.)./$1/gr =~ s!([/\\])!\\$1!r;
my $even = $chars =~ s/.(.)/$1/gr =~ s!([/\\])!\\$1!r;
</code></pre>

<p>We can now use <code>y///dc</code> to remove any characters which aren't in the
sets we need to extract &mdash; this leaves use with the characters we need
to extract. Since <code>y///</code> doesn't do interpolation, we use <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlfunc#eval"><code>eval</code></a>.
And this explains why we need to escape any slashes above.</p>

<pre><code>say eval "y/$odds//dcr";
say eval "y/$even//dcr";
</code></pre>
