<p>The <strong>Wazir</strong> is one of the basic leapers. It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four orthogonal directions.</p>

<p>In the Shogi variant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobutsu_shogi">D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi</a>,
the <em>Giraffe</em> moves in the same way as the <strong>Wazir</strong>.</p>

<p>The <a href="archbishop.html">Knight-Bishop compound</a> is sometimes called a
<em>Wazir</em> as well.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>Because the <strong>Wazir</strong> can always make a step in each of the four orthogonal
directions, it can follow the Spiral, visiting all the squares in order.
As such, if will fill the entire board in a boring pattern.</p>

<p>It also means that any piece which can move as the <strong>Wazir</strong> (even when
it has more moves available, like the Chess <a href="king.html"><em>King</em></a>), will
follow the Spiral and fill the entire board.</p>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Wazir</strong> gets trapped after no more than 6 steps!</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Wazir</strong> escapes to infinity, following a zigzag
pattern on the right edge of the Flat Wedge.</p>
