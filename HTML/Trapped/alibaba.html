<body><h1>Alibaba</h1><div class = "byline">

</div>


<p>The <strong>Alibaba</strong> combines the movements of the <a href="alfil.html"><em>Alfil</em></a> and
<a href="dabbaba.html"><em>Dabbaba</em></a>. This makes it a <em>combined leaper</em>, as it
combines the movements of two or more <em>basic leapers</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Alibaba</strong> jumps to a square two squares away from its starting
point. It may jump over occupied squares. 
This makes the <strong>Alibaba</strong>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound">colourbound</a> &mdash; that is,
if it starts on a black square, it will always be on a black
square and if it starts on a white square, it will always be on
a white square. As such, it cannot reach more than 50% of the squares.</p>

<p>If one would remove all the odd rows and odd files (none of them 
reachable by the <strong>Alibaba</strong>), the <strong>Alibaba</strong> moves like the 
<a href="king.html"><em>King</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Dervish</em> in <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/scirocco"><em>Scirocco</em></a>
and <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised"><em>Typhoon</em></a> moves in
the same way as the <strong>Alibaba</strong>. In addition, the <em>Dervish</em> gives
friendly pieces adjacent to it extra move abilities, but we can
ignore that. The <em>Dervish</em> promotes to the <a href="genie.html?piece=harpy"><em>Harpy</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Alibaba</strong> follows the Spiral, but then with
its path blown up by a factor of two.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<p>The <strong>Alibaba</strong> visits the same squares on both the Flat and Folded
Wedge, visiting the squares in the same order. It visits every other
square of ever other rows. Mostly going right to left, and left to
right, but with a small sidestep before reaching the left end of a row.</p>
