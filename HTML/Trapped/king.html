</div>


<p>The <strong>King</strong> (&#x2654;) can step one square away in all eight directions.</p>

<p>The <strong>King</strong> is a <em>Royal Piece</em>, which means that if it's captured,
that side loses. Of course, for our investigation, Royalness plays
no part.</p>

<p>The <strong>King</strong> appears in many Chess variants, sometimes
by different names.</p>

<p>The <strong>King</strong> in <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a> and
<a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/scirocco">Scirocco</a> promotes to
the <a href="king.html?piece=emperor"><em>Emperor</em></a>. In
<a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a> under some conditions the
<strong>King</strong> may
also promote to the <a href="emperor_of_emperors.html"><em>Emperor of Emperors</em></a>.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)</a> the <strong>King</strong> is also
called the <em>King General</em> (&#x738b;&#x5c07;) (for one side) and the
<em>Jeweled General</em> (&#x7389;&#x5c07;) (for the other side).</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Shogi">Tori Sh&#x14d;gi</a>,
the <strong>King</strong> is known as the <em>Phoenix</em> (&#x9d6c;).</p>

<p>In the Sh&#x14d;gi variant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobutsu_shogi">D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi</a>,
the <strong>King</strong> is known as the <em>Lion</em>.</p>

<h3 id = 'other_royal_king_movers'>Other Royal King movers</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>The <em>Tiger Prince</em>, as found in <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a>
moves (but does not capture) as the <strong>King</strong>. (It captures as the
<a href="dabbaba.html"><em>Dabbaba</em></a> or <a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a>, but we ignore
capture moves). The <a href="blind_tiger.html"><em>Blind Tiger</em></a> promotes to the
[<em>Tiger Prince</em>].</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'non_royal_king_movers'>Non Royal King movers</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p><a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/scirocco">Scirocco</a> and
<a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a> have the <em>Commoner</em>, which moves
exactly as the <strong>King</strong>, but which is not Royal. The <em>Commoner</em> promotes
to a <a href="gnu.html?piece=wildebeest"><em>Wildebeest</em></a>.</p>

<p>Also in <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a> is the
<em>Elephant Prince</em>. This moves, but not capture, as the <strong>King</strong>. It also
captures like the <a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a> and <a href="alfil.html"><em>Alfil</em></a>, but
we ignore captures. The <em>Elephant Prince</em> is the promoted 
<a href="drunk_elephant.html"><em>Drunk Elephant</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Cicada</em> from <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a> moves
(but does not capture) as the <strong>King</strong>. The <em>Cicada</em> also has hopping
moves and captures in the directions of the <a href="queen.html"><em>Queen</em></a>,
but we will ignore hopping moves as we're studying the movements of
a single piece on an infinite board &mdash; so there will not be any other
piece to hop over. The <em>Cicada</em> promotes to the 
<a href="genie.html?piece=typoon"><em>Typhoon</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Overtaker</em> from <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a> moves
as the <strong>King</strong>. To capture, the <em>Overtaker</em> must hop, but we ignore
capturing moves. The <em>Overtaker</em> promotes to the
<a href="knightrider.html"><em>Nightrider</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Salamander</em>, also from <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a>,
moves as the <strong>King</strong>. It can also move as the <a href="queen.html"><em>Queen</em></a>
(up to four squares), but only if it lands adjacent to a friendly piece.
We can ignore such moves. The <em>Salamander</em> promotes to the
<a href="genie.html"><em>Genie</em></a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Undertaker</em>, as found in <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a>,
moves like the <strong>King</strong>. To capture, it has to move away from an adjacent
enemy piece (but we ignore captures). The <em>Undertaker</em> promotes to
the <a href="dayrider.html"><em>Dayrider</em></a>.</p>

<p>Other names for this piece include:
include <em>Mann</em> (not Royal), and <em>Prince</em> (sometimes Royal). </p>

<div class = "section">
<p>The <strong>King</strong> can move as the <a href="wazir.html"><em>Wazir</em></a>, and the
<a href="wazir.html"><em>Wazir</em></a>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>The <strong>King</strong> can move as the <a href="flying_cock.html"><em>Flying Cock</em></a>,

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>King</strong> fills the board row by row, alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge.</p>
