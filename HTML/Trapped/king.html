<p>The Chess King (&#x2654;) can step one square away in all eight directions.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)</a> has Kings as well,
the King General (&#x738b;&#x5c07;) and Jeweled General (&#x7389;&#x5c07;),
which moves in exactly the same way. (King General and Jeweled General
are names for the same piece, but of opposite sides).</p>

<p>A <em>Mann</em> is a piece which moves in exactly the same way, but a Mann
is not <em>royal</em>. (Royal pieces are pieces which need lead to a loss
of the game when they are captured). Royalness however, does not
matter in our investigation. A <em>Prince</em> is another name for a <em>Mann</em>.</p>

<p>In the Shogi variant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobutsu_shogi">D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi</a>,
the King is known as the <em>Lion</em>.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>The King can move as the <a href="wazir.html">Wazir</a>, and the <a href="wazir.html">Wazir</a>
will follow the Spiral. Hence, the King will visit all the squares on
the board.</p>

<h4 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h4>

<p>The King can move as the <a href="gold_general.html">Gold General</a>,
and the <a href="gold_general.html">Gold General</a>
will follow the Wedge. Hence, the King will visit all the squares on
the board.</p>
