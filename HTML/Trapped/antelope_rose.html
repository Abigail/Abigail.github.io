<p>The %%PIECE%% makes repeated <a href="antelope.html"><em>Antelope</em></a> steps, but unlike the 
<a href="antelope_rider.html"><em>Antelope Rider</em></a>, the %%PIECE%% turns on each step
(the minimum turn possible). After 8 such steps, it is back at
the square it started on. Given that it start in 8 directions,
and move either clockwise or counter-clockwise, it can reach
quite a number of squares in one move. (Each square of its in between
steps need to be unoccupied though). On a large enough board, away from 
any borders, the %%PIECE%% can reach 32 different squares, assuming
all squares are unoccupied.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves outward, keeping always a 
near square as the boundary of squares visited. It probably won't
get trapped, and certainly doesn't do in its first 10,000 steps.</p>

<h4 id = 'diamond'>Diamond</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves outward, keeping always a 
near, rotated, square as the boundary of squares visited. It probably won't
get trapped, and certainly doesn't do in its first 10,000 steps.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>The %%PIECE%% seems to fill the Folded Wedge completely, working on just
a few rows at the time. It probably won't get trapped, and it certainly
doesn't do so in its first 10,000 steps.</p>

<p>The %%PIECE%% get trapped after a mere 86 steps.</p>
