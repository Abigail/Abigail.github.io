<p>The <strong>Frog</strong> is a piece which is used in <em>Fairy Chess problems</em>. 
It's an <em>amphibian</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Frog</strong> either leaps three squares in any of the four orthogonal
directions, or steps one square diagonally.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/contest/scirocco.html#Frog">piece with the same name</a>
also appeared in the
<a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/large.dir/contest/scirocco.html">original version of Scirocco Chess</a>,
but it has disappered from the
<a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/invention/scirocco">revised version</a>. This piece moves
differently though.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Frog</strong> doesn't get trapped for the first 20,000
steps, but the path it traces doesn't seem to be regular enough to
state it will never get trapped.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Frog</strong> will visit all the squares.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flate'>Flate</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Frog</strong> will also visit all the squares,
having a slight bias to the right hand side of the Flat Wedge.</p>
