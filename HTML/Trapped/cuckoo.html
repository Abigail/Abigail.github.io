<p>The <strong>Cuckoo</strong> either moves one square sideways, or two squares
orthogonally forward. It also has the ability to change the colour
of pieces, but that is irrelevant here.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a>, the <strong>Cuckoo</strong>
promotes to the <a href="queen.html?piece=longleaper"><em>Longleaper</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Cuckoo</strong> visits every second row going forward
from the origin. It will visits that part where the numbers on the
Spiral are consecutive (so, from where the spiral turns left on to
the row, till where it the spiral turns left again). As such, it will
visit 12.5% of the board.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<p>On both the Folded Wedge and the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Cuckoo</strong> will visit
the three right most squares of every second row, escaping to infinity
that way.</p>
