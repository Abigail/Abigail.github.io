<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Archbishop</strong> follows an irregular pattern
in a clockwise direction around the origin, getting trapped after
6386 steps.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Archbishop</strong> fills the board evenly.
There will only be a handful of rows which have been partially 
visited. A few different patterns are used when the 
<strong>Archbishop</strong> goes from one side of the wedge to the other.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Archbishop</strong> also fills the entire board,
but it has a strong bias to the right hand side of the Wedge.
The distance between the highest completed row, and the lowest
unvisited row will always be increasing.</p>
