<p>The <strong>Pawn</strong> appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)</a>, and many of its
variants.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Shogi"><em>Tori Sh&#x14d;gi</em></a>, the pieces is called a
<em>Swallow</em>.</p>

<p>It's usually a humble piece, appearing multiple times on the board.
It's movements are complicated, but most movements we can ignore
for our investigations:</p>

<ul>
<li>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> and its variants, the <strong>Pawn</strong> captures differently
than it moves. However we can ignore capture moves.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> and its variants also have <em>en passant</em> moves, special
capture moves. We will ignore those as well.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> and its variants, it is typically the only piece
which promotes (to a piece selected by the player). In
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)</a>, the <strong>Pawn</strong> promotes
to the <a href="gold_general.html"><em>Gold General</em></a>. In
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Shogi"><em>Tori Sh&#x14d;gi</em></a>, the <strong>Swallow</strong> promotes to
the <a href="goose.html"><em>Goose</em></a>.
We can, however, ignore all promotions.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">Chess</a> and many of its variants, the <strong>Pawn</strong> may optionally
take a double (and in larger variants, a triple) step on its first
move. For none of the numbering systems we use, the <strong>Pawn</strong> will
make use of this option, so we can ignore this as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>This makes that the <strong>Pawn</strong> is left with only one possible move:
one square forward.</p>

<p>On the Spiral and both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the <strong>Pawn</strong>
escapes to infinity in a straight line forward.</p>
