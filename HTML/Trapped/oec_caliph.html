<p>The <strong>Caliph</strong> is a piece from <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess"><em>Overkill Ecumenical
Chess</em></a>.</p>

<p>This pieces moves as either the <a href="bishop.html"><em>Bishop</em></a> or as
the <a href="camel.html"><em>Camel</em></a>. That is, it can slide an unlimited
number of squares diagonally (as long as all the squares it passes
over are unoccupied), or it jumps to a square which is 3 squares
away in one orthogonal direction, and 1 square away in the
other direction. Since both the <em>Bishop</em> and <em>Camel</em> are 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound">colourbound</a>, so is the
<em>Caliph</em>.</p>

<p>There is another piece called <a href="caliph.html"><em>Caliph</em></a>, which
combines the moves of the <a href="wazir.html"><em>Wazir</em></a> and <a href="alfil.html"><em>Alfil</em></a>.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>Using a simple, but pretty, pattern, the <strong>Caliph</strong> fills 50% 
(due to it being colourbound) of the Folded Wedge.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>Using a very simple pattern, the <strong>Caliph</strong> fills 50% (due to it
being colourbound) of the Flat Wedge. While simple, the travel pattern
is interesting in the sense that the path the <strong>Caliph</strong> traces
does not intersect itself. For the Flat Wedge, that's pretty rare
for a piece which fills the Wedge.</p>
