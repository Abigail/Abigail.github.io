<p>The <strong>Right Quail</strong> either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares 
orthogonally forward, or slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
diagonally left-backward, or steps one square right-backward.</p>

<p>THe <strong>Right Quail</strong> is a piece from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tori_Shogi"><em>Tori Sh&#x14d;gi</em></a>.
Its mirror image (mirrored around a vertical line) is the
<a href="right_quail.html"><em>Left Quail</em></a>.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Right Quail</strong> visits 25% of the squares on the
board. If we draw two diagonals through the origin, dividing the
board into four quadrants, the <strong>Right Quail</strong> visits all the 
squares in the left quadrant. This is different from the <strong>Left Quail</strong>,
which gets trapped after 146 steps.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Right Quail</strong> will only visit the three
left most squares of each row (except the bottom two), escaping
to infinity by sticking to the left side of the board. This is
exactly the same pattern the <a href="left_quail.html"><em>Left Quail</em></a> leaves
behind.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>The movement of the <strong>Right Quail</strong> on the Flat Wedge is a mirror
image of the movement on the Folded Wedge: the three right most
squares of each row are visited while the <strong>Left Quail</strong> escapes
to infinity. This is exactly the same pattern the
<a href="left_quail.html"><em>Left Quail</em></a> leaves behind.</p>
