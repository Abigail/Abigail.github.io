<p>The <strong>Bishop</strong> (&#x2657;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in
each of the four diagonal directions, as long as the squares it
slides over are not occupied. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)</a>
has the <em>Angle Mover</em> (&#x89d2;&#x884c;) which moves in the same
way (which is way the piece is also called a <strong>Bishop</strong>).</p>

<p>Due to its diagonal movement, the <strong>Bishop</strong> is <em>colour bound</em>: if it
starts a move on a dark square, it ends the move on a dark square.
And if it starts on a light square, it ends on a light square. As such,
the <strong>Bishop</strong> can only reach half the squares of the board.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bishop</strong> is a <a href="ferz.html"><em>Ferz</em></a><em>rider</em>, that is, it moves in the
same directions as the <a href="ferz.html"><em>Ferz</em></a>, without a limit on
the number of squares it moves over (as long as the squares it
moves over are unoccupied).</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Bishop</strong> moves in a regular pattern. However, 
despite the possible moves of the <strong>Bishop</strong> being four fold symmetric,
the resulting pattern isn't, making the <strong>Bishop</strong> slightly interesting.</p>

<p>If we take the limit, we see that the <strong>Bishop</strong> will visit
\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) =
  \frac{5}{16} = 31.25 \%\) of the squares on the board.</p>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Bishop</strong> quickly escapes to infinity, moving in
a stepwise pattern.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Bishop</strong> escapes as well, keep to the right
edge of the Wedge.</p>
