<p>The <strong>Alfil</strong> is a (2,2)-leaper. On each step, it jumps to a square
which is two away diagonally. It can jump over an occupied square.
This makes the <strong>Alfil</strong>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound">colourbound</a> &mdash; that is,
if it starts on a black square, it will always be on a black
square and if it starts on a white square, it will always be on
a white square.</p>

<p>The <strong>Alfil</strong> is more limited than just being
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound">colourbound</a>. If we give its
starting square the coordinates <span class = 'latex-inline'>\((0, 0)\)</span>, then the only squares
it can reach are the squares <span class = 'latex-inline'>\((x, y)\)</span> such that <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(x\)</span> is even,
<span class = 'latex-inline'>\(y\)</span> is even, and <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(x + y\)</span> is a multiple of <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(4\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Alfil</strong> moves in a similar fashion as the
<a href="ferz.html"><em>Ferz</em></a>, except that it's path is blown up by a factor two.
It will visit all the squares of the board which satisfy the condition
above. As such, the <strong>Alfil</strong> visits <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(12.5\%\)</span> of the board.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<p>On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the <strong>Alfil</strong> escapes to infinity
by visiting the right most square of each second row.</p>
