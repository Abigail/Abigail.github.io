<p>The <strong>Stag</strong> is a (4, 2)-leaper; that is, on each move it moves
to a square which is four away in one orthogonal direction, and
two away in the other. (It moves in the same directions as the
<a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a>, but twice as far).</p>

<p>This makes the <strong>Stag</strong> not only <em>colourbound</em>, it means it can
only reach squares which are both on even row, and an even file.
Hence, it can only reach 11.1% of the squares on the board.</p>

<h3 id = 'spiral'>Spiral</h3>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Stag</strong> moves exactly as the <a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a>,
but with the path blown up by a factor of two. It gets trapped on
step 2,015.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Stag</strong> bounces around for a couple of
moves before it falls into a pattern where it visits four out of
the last seven squares of each second row. It escapes to infinity
staying on the right hand side of the board.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Stag</strong> moves in exactly the same was as
on the Folded Wedge &mdash; which isn't very surprising as the <strong>Stag</strong>
only visits the even rows, and the even rows on the Flat Wedge are
the same as on the Folded Wedge.</p>
