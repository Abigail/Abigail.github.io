<p>The %%PIECE%% is a (4,2)-<a href="leapers.html"><em>Leaper</em></a>; that is, on each move it moves
to a square which is four away in one orthogonal direction, and
two away in the other. (It moves in the same directions as the
<a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a>, but twice as far).</p>

<p>This makes the %%PIECE%% not only <span class = 'tooltip underline'>colourbound<span class = 'tooltiptext'>A colourbound piece will always stay on a square of the same colour: if it starts on a black square, it will always remain on a black square; if it starts on a white square, it will always remain on a white square</span></span>, it means it can
only reach squares which are both on even row, and an even file.
Hence, it can only reach 11.1% of the squares on the board.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves exactly as the <a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a>,
but with the path blown up by a factor of two. It gets trapped on
step 2,015.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'diamond'>Diamond</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>Just like the <a href="knight.html"><em>Knight</em></a>, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped after 3,722 steps.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% bounces around for a couple of
moves before it falls into a pattern where it visits four out of
the last seven squares of each second row. It uses a four step loop
to move two square forward and to the right. This gives it an
escape velocity of <span class = 'latex-inline'>\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)</span>.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% moves in exactly the same was as
on the Folded Wedge &mdash; which isn't very surprising as the %%PIECE%%
only visits the even rows, and the even rows on the Flat Wedge are
the same as on the Folded Wedge. Hence the escape velocity is
<span class = 'latex-inline'>\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)</span>.</p>
