<p>The <strong>Horned Owl</strong> either moves up to four unoccupied squares diagonally
(like a restricted <a href="bishop.html"><em>Bishop</em></a>), jumps to a square two away
in a orthogonal direction, or one square orthogonally forward.
Additionally, the <strong>Horned Owl</strong> has some hopping capture moves and 
some non-moving captures available, as well as the option to pass. 
But we can ignore those.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/typhoon-revised">Typhoon</a>, the
<a href="gold_general.html"><em>Gold General</em></a> promotes to the <strong>Horned Owl</strong>.</p>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Spiral, the <strong>Horned Owl</strong> doesn't get trapped for its first
20,000 steps. It doesn't quite settle into a repeating pattern, so
while it looks like it doesn't get trapped, we don't know for sure.</p>
</div>

<h3 id = 'wedge'>Wedge</h3>

<h4 id = 'folded'>Folded</h4>

<div class = "section">
<p>On the Folded Wedge, the <strong>Horned Owl</strong> visits very odd square of each
row, so in the limit, it will visit half of the squares on the board.</p>
</div>

<h4 id = 'flat'>Flat</h4>

<p>On the Flat Wedge, the <strong>Horned Owl</strong> uses an interesting pattern making
multiple sweeps over each row to visit all the squares.</p>
