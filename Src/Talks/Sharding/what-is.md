# What is Sharding?

<!-- %% svg-grid: none -->

<blockquote>
A database shard, or simply a shard, is a horizontal partition of
data in a database or search engine. Each shard may be held on a
separate database server instance, to spread load.
<p>
Some data in a database remains present in all shards, but some
appears only in a single shard. Each shard acts as the single source
for this subset of data.
