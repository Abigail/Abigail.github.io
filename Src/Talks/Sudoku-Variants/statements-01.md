# Statements

<!-- %% svg-grid: none -->
<!-- %% hide           -->

* We will turn conditions and constraints into *statements*.
* A statement consists of a part of the subject, and a subpattern
  which exactly matches this part.
* Each part of the subject and each subpattern is terminated
  with a `;`.
