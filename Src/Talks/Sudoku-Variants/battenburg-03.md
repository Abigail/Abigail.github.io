# Variant: Battenburg

<!-- %% svg-grid: none -->
<!-- %% hide           -->

* For the Battenburg constraints:
    * Six pair wise constraints
    * Opposite squares must have same parity
    * Neighbouring squares must have different parity
    * Three constraints would be enough, but we use all six
