# Statement: Cells must differ

<!-- %% svg-grid: none -->
<!-- %% hide           -->

* All values in a group must differ from each other.
* Each pair of cells in a group must differ.
* So must each pair of cells which touch each other.
* List all pairs of values which are different (hence, allowed),
  then match a pair.
