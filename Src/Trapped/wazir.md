The **Wazir** is a [*(0,1)-leaper*](leapers.html#basic_leapers).
It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four orthogonal directions. Many games have a piece which moves as
the **Wazir**.

The [*Knight-Bishop compound*](archbishop.html) is sometimes called a
**Wazir** as well.

### Spiral

#### Square

Because the **Wazir** can always make a step in each of the four orthogonal
directions, it can follow the Spiral, visiting all the squares in order.
As such, if will fill the entire board in a boring pattern.

It also means that any piece which can move as the **Wazir** (even when
it has more moves available, like the Chess [*King*](king.html)), will
follow the Spiral and fill the entire board.

#### Diamond

The pattern the **Wazir** moves on the Diamond Spiral it the mirror
image of the pattern the **Wazir** moves on the Square Spiral. Hence,
it visits all the squares on the board. However, not all pieces whose
movements are a superset of the movements of the **Wazir** will 
follow this pattern on the Diamond Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Wazir** gets trapped after no more than 6 steps!

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Wazir** escapes to infinity, following a zigzag
pattern on the right edge of the Flat Wedge. This gives it an 
escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
