# Wazir

The Wazir is one of the basic leapers. It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four orthogonal directions.

As such, it can always follow the spiral. It will not get trapped,
and it will eventually visit every square on the board. This is
true for *any* piece whose possible moves are a superset of the
moves of a Wazir. This includes the [King](king.html), 
[Queen](queen.html) and [Rook](rook.html) from traditional chess.
