# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% is a [*(0,1)-leaper*](leapers.html#basic_leapers).
It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four orthogonal directions. Many games have a piece which moves as
the %%PIECE%%.

            or the [Queen + Knight compound](amazon.html?piece=giraffe) also
            named *Giraffe* \\

The [Knight-Bishop compound](archbishop.html) is sometimes called a
*Wazir* as well.

### Spiral

Because the %%PIECE%% can always make a step in each of the four orthogonal
directions, it can follow the Spiral, visiting all the squares in order.
As such, if will fill the entire board in a boring pattern.

It also means that any piece which can move as the %%PIECE%% (even when
it has more moves available, like the Chess [*King*](king.html)), will
follow the Spiral and fill the entire board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped after no more than 6 steps!

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity, following a zigzag
pattern on the right edge of the Flat Wedge.
