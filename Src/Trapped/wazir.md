# Wazir

The **Wazir** is one of the basic leapers. It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four orthogonal directions.

In the Shogi variant [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi),
the *Giraffe* moves in the same way as the **Wazir**.

The [Knight-Bishop compound](archbishop.html) is sometimes called a
*Wazir* as well.

### Spiral

Because the **Wazir** can always make a step in each of the four orthogonal
directions, it can follow the Spiral, visiting all the squares in order.
As such, if will fill the entire board in a boring pattern.

It also means that any piece which can move as the **Wazir** (even when
it has more moves available, like the Chess [*King*](king.html)), will
follow the Spiral and fill the entire board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Wazir** gets trapped after no more than 6 steps!

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Wazir** escapes to infinity, following a zigzag
pattern on the right edge of the Flat Wedge.
