The **Lioness** combines the movments of the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
[*Ferz*](ferz.html),
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html), [*Knight*](knight.html) and [*Alfil*](alfil.html).
This means, the **Lioness** can jump anywhere in a 5 x 5 square centered
around the starting position (but it can't jump to the starting square).

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Lioness** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it will
follow the Spiral.

#### Diamond

The **Lioness** can move as the %%BM%% so it will
follow the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Lioness** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
so it will follow the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Lioness** fills the board row by row, where each row
has half its squares visited on a left to right sweep, then the
rest is visited on a right to left sweep. When all the squares
in a row have been visited, the **Lioness** moves to the next row.
