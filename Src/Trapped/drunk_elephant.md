### Spiral

The %%PIECE%% fills the entire board, but it does so in an
unusual manner. It fills up the board in an expanding, roughly triangle
shaped pattern.
It adds three rows at the top, for each row at the right and left
side of the triangle.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
causing the %%PIECE%% to follow the numbers.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% moves in the same way as
the [*King*](king.html) does, filling the wedge row by row, going from
right to left and left to right, with a small side step before
reaching the left end of each row.
