# Drunk Elephant

The **Drunk Elephant** moves one square in any direction, except backwards.

The **Drunk Elephant** is found in [*Chu Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Chu_Shogi).

In [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi), the *Falcon (&#x9df9;)* moves in
the same way, and promotes to the [*Eagle*](eagle.hmtl).
(This is a different piece than the [*Falcon*](falcon.html) found in
*Falcon-Hunter Chess*).

### Spiral

The **Drunk Elephant** fills the entire board, but it does so in an
unusual manner. It fills up the board in an expanding, roughly triangle
shaped pattern.
It adds three rows at the top, for each row at the right and left
side of the triangle.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Drunk Elephant** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
causing the **Drunk Elephant** to follow the numbers.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Drunk Elephant** moves in the same way as
the [*King*](king.html), filling the wedge row by row, going from
right to left and left to right, with a small side step before
reaching the left end of each row.
