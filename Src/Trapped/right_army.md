The **Right Army** either slides an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally right-forward, or diagonally right-backward, (like a right
%%BISHOP%%), slides an unlimited number of unoccupied squares orthogonally
to the right (like a right %%ROOK%%), or steps one square in any of the
eight cardinal directions (like a %%KING%%).

The **Right Army** mirrors the movements of the
[*Left Army*](left_army.html).
