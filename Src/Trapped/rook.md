### Spiral

#### Square

Since the %%PIECE%%'s movement is a superset of the movement of the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html), it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% uses a regular pattern to fill
\(\frac{5}{8} = 62.5\%\) of the board. This pattern is similar, but
rotated 45&deg; of the pattern the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) uses on
the Square Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped very quickly, after 6 moves.
This is the same number of moves that the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) takes before
it gets trapped, but there is a slight difference in which squares
are visited.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge the %%PIECE%% quickly escapes to infinity by alternating make 
a step forward, and a step to the right. This gives it an escape
velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) .
