# Rook &#x2656;

The Rook can slide an unlimited number of squares in all four orthogonal
directions, as long as it does not slide over an occupied square. But
this means that it can, just like the [King](king.html),
follow the spiral one square
at a time. It will trace exactly the same path as the King does.
