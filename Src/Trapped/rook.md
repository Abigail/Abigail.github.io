# Rook

The Rook (&#x2656;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in all
four orthogonal directions, as long as it does not slide over an
occupied square. [Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) also has
a Rook, the Flying Chariot (&#x98db;&#x8eca;), which moves in exactly
the same way.

Since the Rook's movement is a superset of the movement of the
[Wazir](wazir.html), it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.
