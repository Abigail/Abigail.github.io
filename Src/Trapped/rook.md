# Rook

The Rook (&#x2656;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in all
four orthogonal directions, as long as it does not slide over an
occupied square. [Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) also has
a Rook, the Flying Chariot (&#x98db;&#x8eca;), which moves in exactly
the same way.

The Rook is a [Wazir](wazir.html)rider, that it, it moves in the same
directions as the [Wazir](wazir.html), without a limit on the number
of squares it moves over (but all the intermediate squares must be empty).

#### Spiral

Since the Rook's movement is a superset of the movement of the
[Wazir](wazir.html), it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.

#### Wedge

On the Wedge, the Rook gets trapped very quickly, after 6 moves. This
is the same number of moves that the [Wazir](wazir.html) takes before
it gets trapped, but there is a slight difference in which squares
are visited.
