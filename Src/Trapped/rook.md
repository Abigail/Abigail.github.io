# Rook

The **Rook** (&#x2656;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in all
four orthogonal directions, as long as it does not slide over an
occupied square.

The *Flying Chariot* (&#x98db;&#x8eca;) in 
[Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) moves exactly as
the **Rook**; it's often indicates as *Rook* by Westeners. The
*Flying Chariot* promotes to a [*Dragon King*](dragon_king.html).

The **Rook** is a [*Wazir*](wazir.html)*rider*, that it, it moves in the same
directions as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), without a limit on the number
of squares it moves over (but all the intermediate squares must be empty).

### Spiral

Since the **Rook**'s movement is a superset of the movement of the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html), it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Rook** gets trapped very quickly, after 6 moves. This
is the same number of moves that the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) takes before
it gets trapped, but there is a slight difference in which squares
are visited.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge the **Rook** quickly escapes to infinity by alternating make 
a step forward, and a step to the right.
