# Rook

The **Rook** (&#x2656;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in all
four orthogonal directions, as long as it does not slide over an
occupied square.

In [Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi), the **Rook** is
also known as the *Flying Chariot* (&#x98db;&#x8eca;). It can 
promote to a [*Dragon King (&#x9f8d;&#x738b;)*](dragon_king.html).

The **Rook** is a [*Wazir*](wazir.html)*rider*, that it, it moves in the same
directions as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), without a limit on the number
of squares it moves over (but all the intermediate squares must be empty).

In [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), and
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Rook** is the promoted
[*Knight*](knight.html).

### Spiral

Since the **Rook**'s movement is a superset of the movement of the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html), it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Rook** gets trapped very quickly, after 6 moves. This
is the same number of moves that the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) takes before
it gets trapped, but there is a slight difference in which squares
are visited.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge the **Rook** quickly escapes to infinity by alternating make 
a step forward, and a step to the right.
