The **Rook** can slide an unlimited number of squares in all
four orthogonal directions, as long as it does not slide over an
occupied square.

The **Rook** extends the movements of the %%WAZIR%%, making it a
*Wazirrider*.

Many games have pieces which move like the **Rook**, using various
names.

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the **Rook** movement is a superset of the movement of the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html), it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Rook** uses a regular pattern to fill
\(\frac{5}{8} = 62.5\%\) of the board. This pattern is similar, but
rotated 45&deg; of the pattern the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) uses on
the Square Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Rook** gets trapped very quickly, after 6 moves.
This is the same number of moves that the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) takes before
it gets trapped, but there is a slight difference in which squares
are visited.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge the **Rook** quickly escapes to infinity by alternating make 
a step forward, and a step to the right. This gives it an escape
velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) .
