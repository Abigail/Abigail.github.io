# Frog

The **Frog** is a piece which is used in *Fairy Chess problems*. 
It's an *amphibian*.

The **Frog** either leaps three squares in any of the four orthogonal
directions, or steps one square diagonally.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Frog** doesn't get trapped for the first 20,000
steps, but the path it traces doesn't seem to be regular enough to
state it will never get trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Frog** will visit all the squares.

#### Flate

On the Flat Wedge, the **Frog** will also visit all the squares,
having a slight bias to the right hand side of the Flat Wedge.
