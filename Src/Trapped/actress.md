# Actress

The **Actress** is a piece from [*Overkill Ecumenical
Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess).

The **Actress** combines the movements of the
[*Queen*](queen.html), and the [*Gnu*](gnu.html).
(The [*Gnu*](gnu.html) combines
the movements of the [*Knight*](knight.html) and [*Camel*](camel.html).)

### Spiral

Since the **Actress** can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the **Actress** fills the entire 
board by just following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Actress** can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), the **Actress** fills the entire 
board by just following the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Actress** fills the entire board in a not
very interesting pattern.
