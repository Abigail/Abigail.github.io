### Spiral

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the **Actress** fills the entire 
board by just following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), the %%PIECE%% fills the entire 
board by just following the Wedge.
