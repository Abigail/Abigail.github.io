# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% is a *short rook*: a piece which moves like
a [*Rook*](rook.html), but with a limited range. The %%PIECE%%
slides up to four unoccupied squares in any orthogonal direction.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
hence it fills the board by following the spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Just like the [*Rook*](rook.html), the %%PIECE%% gets trapped after
six steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes. It visits the two right
most squares of each row; the travel pattern for the %%PIECE%%
is the same as for the [*Rook*](rook.html).
