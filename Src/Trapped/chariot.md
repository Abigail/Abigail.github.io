# Chariot

The **Chariot** is a *short rook*: a piece which moves like
a [*Rook*](rook.html), but with a limited range. The **Chariot**
slides up to four unoccupied squares in an orthogonal direction.

The **Chariot** is a piece in [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), 
and in [*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised).
In both games, it promotes to the [*Octopus*](octopus.html).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, it can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), hence it
fills the board by following the spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Just like the [*Rook*](rook.html), the **Chariot** gets trapped after
six steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Chariot** escapes. It visits the two right
most squares of each row; the travel pattern for the **Chariot**
is the same as for the [*Rook*](rook.html).
