### Spiral

#### Square

The **Silver General** visits all the squares of the Square Spiral, in
a unique pattern, with a strong bias to the upper right.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Silver General** circles the origin counter
clockwise in a simple pattern. All squares on the board will
be visited.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Silver General** follows the same pattern
as the [*Ferz*](ferz.html), visiting two squares on each row.
It escapes to the upper right, using a three step loop to 
move one square to the upper right. Its escape velocity is
\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Silver General** visits the right most
square of each row, and no other squares. This gives it
an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{2}\).
