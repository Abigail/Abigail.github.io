# Marquis

The **Marquis** is a *combined leaper*, combining the moves of
the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) and [*Knight*](knight.html). That is,
the **Marquis** either moves one square in an orthogonal direction,
or jumps to a square which is two squares away in one orthogonal
direction, and one away in the other.

In [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) and 
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Marquis** promotes
to the [*Abbot*](abbot.html).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Marquis** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html).
As such, it will follow the Spiral, filling the board in a boring way.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Marquis** fills the board going from one
side to another, bouncing up and down between two successive rows.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Marquis** also fills the board going from
one side to another, bouncing up and down between two succesive rows,
but it uses a slightly different pattern as on the Folded Wedge.
