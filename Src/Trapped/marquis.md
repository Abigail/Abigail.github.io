# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% is a %%COMPOUND_LEAPER%%, combining the moves of
the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) and [*Knight*](knight.html). That is,
the %%PIECE%% either moves one square in any orthogonal direction,
or jumps to a square which is two squares away in one orthogonal
direction, and one away in the other.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html).
As such, it will follow the Spiral, filling the board in a boring way.

#### Diamond

It's not clear whether the %%PIECE%% gets trapped on the Diamond Spiral.
It does not get trapped in its first billion steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% fills the board going from one
side to another, bouncing up and down between two successive rows.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% also fills the board going from
one side to another, bouncing up and down between two succesive rows,
but it uses a slightly different pattern as on the Folded Wedge.
