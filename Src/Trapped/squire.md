The **Squire** combines the movements of the %%WAZIR%%, %%FERZ%%,
%%ALFIL%% and the %%DABBABA%%. 
That is, the **Squire** moves one or two squares in any of the orthogonal or
diagonal directions, possibly jumping over any occupied square.

Compare with the [*Sorcerer*](sorcerer.html) which can move to the same
set of squares, but which cannot jump over occupied squares.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Squire** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so
it just follows the Spiral.

#### Diamond

The **Squire** can move like the %%BM%%, so
it just follows the Spiral.


### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Squire** can move like the %%FC%%, so it just follows the Wedge.

#### Flat

The **Squire** visits every square on the Flat Wedge, by sweeping every
row left to right, and right to left, before going to the next row.
