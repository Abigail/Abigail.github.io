# Dabbaba

The **Dabbaba** is a (2,0)-leaper. That is, the **Dabbaba** jumps
two squares orthogonally. This makes the **Dabbaba**
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound) -- that is,
if it starts on a black square, it will always be on a black
square and if it starts on a white square, it will always be on
a white square. It also keeps parity in both its row and file.
This means, if it starts on an even row (or file), it will remain
on an even row (of file). And if it starts on an odd row (of file),
it will remain on an odd row (or file).

The name is infrequently used for the [Rook + Knight compound](chancellor.md).
