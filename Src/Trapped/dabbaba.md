# Dabbaba

The **Dabbaba** is a (2,0)-leaper. That is, the **Dabbaba** jumps
two squares orthogonally. It can jump over an unoccupied square.
This makes the **Dabbaba**
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound) -- that is,
if it starts on a black square, it will always be on a black
square and if it starts on a white square, it will always be on
a white square. It also keeps parity in both its row and file.
This means, if it starts on an even row (or file), it will remain
on an even row (of file). And if it starts on an odd row (of file),
it will remain on an odd row (or file).

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the **Dabbaba** promotes
to the [*Genie*](genie.html), while in
[*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Dabbaba**
promotes to the [*Dragon Kite*](dragon_king.html?piece=dragon_kite).

The name is infrequently used for the [Rook + Knight compound](chancellor.md).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Dabbaba** acts like a [*Wazir*](wazir.html), except
that it skips all odd rows and odd files. Hence, it fills 25% of
the board.

### Wedge

On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Dabbaba** escapes using
a stepwise pattern: it visits the right most, and third square
from the right, of each second row.
