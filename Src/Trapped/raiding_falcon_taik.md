The **Raiding Falcon** either moves one square to the left or right
(like a sideways %%WAZIR%%), one square diagonally
forward (like a forward %%FERZ%%), or an unlimited
number of unoccupied squares orthogonally forward.
(like a forward %%ROOK%%).

  in a similar way, except it can also slide orthogonally backward. \\

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Raiding Falcon** visits \(25\%\) of the
squares on the board, mostly all of them in the wedge forward from
the origin.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Raiding Falcon** uses a simple two step loop
to move one square forward. This way, it escapes with an escape
velocity of %%HALF%%.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Raiding Falcon** can move as the %%FC%%
so it follows the Folded Wedge, visiting all the squares.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Raiding Falcon** follows almost all the squares
on the board (just missing out on the two left most squares of every
second row), in a pattern very similar to how it moves on the
Square Spiral.
visiting all the squares.
