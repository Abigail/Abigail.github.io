The **Zebu** moves like either the [*Camel*](camel.html)
or the [*Giraffe*](giraffe.html). This makes the **Zebu**
a %%COMPOUND_LEAPER%%, jumping to a square which is one away
in one orthogonal direction, and three or four way in the other.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Zebu** does not get trapped in its first billion steps. But
it doesn't become clear whether it starts following a pattern or
whether it remains free.

#### Diamond

The **Zebu** bounces around wildly, only to get trapped after 
46,359 steps.

### Wedge

Neither on the Folded nor on the Flat Wedge does the **Zebu**
get trapped for its first billion steps. But it remains unclear
whether it never does.
