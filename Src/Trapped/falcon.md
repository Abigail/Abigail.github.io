# Falcon

[Falcon-Hunter Chess](#wiki:Falcon-hunter_chess) is a chess variant
invented by Karl Schultz in 1943.

It introduces two new pieces, the Falcon, and the [Hunter](hunter.html).

The Falcon moves forward like the Chess [Bishop](bishop.html),
and backwards like a Chess [Rook](rook.html).

Despite its moves being a mirror image of the Hunter, the Falcon
doesn't get trapped. It will visit 25% of the squares, in a 
somewhat interesting pattern.

In [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi), there is a 
[different piece with the same name](drunk_elephant.html?piece=tori_falcon).
