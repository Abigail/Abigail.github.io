# Knight &#x2658; 

This is the piece it all started with.

A Knight is a (1, 2)-leaper. That is, a Knight moves from a square
to a square which is 1 unit away in one direction, and 2 units away
in a direction orthogonally to the first direction. The move cannot
be blocked.

See also the [Knightrider](knightrider.html), a piece which moves
one or more squares in the same direction as the Knight.

#### Spiral

Of the traditional Chess pieces, this is the only piece which gets
trapped. Circling the starting point in an irregular way in the
opposite direction as the spiral, the Knight gets trapped after 2015 steps.

#### Wedge

On the Wedge, the Knight gets trapped quickly, after 50 steps.
