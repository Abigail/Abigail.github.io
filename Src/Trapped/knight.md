# %%PIECE%%

This is the piece it all started with.

A %%PIECE%% is a (1, 2)-%%LEAPER%%. That is, a %%PIECE%% moves from a square
to a square which is one square away in one direction, and two squares away
in a direction orthogonally to the first direction. The move cannot
be blocked.

### Spiral

Of the traditional Chess pieces, this is the only piece which gets
trapped on the Spiral. Circling the starting point in an irregular way in the
opposite direction as the spiral, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped after 2,015 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped quickly, after 50 steps. 

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% bounces around for the first 30 steps,
then, making triangular shaped turns, escapes to infinity.
