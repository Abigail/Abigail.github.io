# Fourleaper

The **Fourleaper** jumps to a square four away. It can jump over
any occupied intermediate square. 

This makes the **Fourleaper** not only *colourbound*, it means
the **Fourleaper** can only reach squares \((4 * x, 4 * y)\), for
integers \(x\) and \(y\), assuming it starts from square \((0, 0)\).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Fourleaper** moves in the same manner as
the Spiral, but blown up by a factor of four. It visits 6.25%
of the squares.

### Wedge

On both the Folded Wedge, and the Flat Wedge, the **Fourleaper** only
visits two squares of each fourth row, escaping to infinity using
a step-wise pattern.
