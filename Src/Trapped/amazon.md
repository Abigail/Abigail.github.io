# Amazon

The [**Amazon**](#wiki:Amazon_(chess)) combines the moves from the
[*Queen*](queen.html) and the
[*Knight*](knight.html), which makes it a *Knighted Piece*. The
**Amazon** can either slide an unlimited amount of squares in one
the eight main directions, or jump to a square which is two squares
away in one orthogonal direction, and one square away in the other.

This piece has a long history, and appears in many chess variants. As such,
it's known under various names, including:
*Ace* (in [*Overkill Ecumenical
Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess)),
*Angel*, *Ayanu*, *Commander*, *Crown Prince*, *Elephant*, *Empress*,
*General*, *Giraffe*, *Grand Chancellor*, *Maharajah*, *Rettah*,
*Royal Guard*, *Superqueen*, *Tetra Queen*, and *Wyvern*.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, since the **Amazon** can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html),
it can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and hence will follow the spiral,
visiting all the squares on the board. 

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, since **Amazon** can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html),
it can also move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html). Hence
it will visit all the squares on the board, in order of the values.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Amazon** fills the entire board, in a 
rather simple pattern.

<div class = 'trapped' data-piece = 'amazon'></div>
<div class = 'boxset'  data-sets  = 'overkill_ecumenical_chess'></div>
