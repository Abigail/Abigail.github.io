# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the moves from the
[*Queen*](queen.html) and the
[*Knight*](knight.html), which makes it a *Knighted Piece*. The
%%PIECE%% can either slide an unlimited amount of squares in one
the eight main directions, or jump to a square which is two squares
away in one orthogonal direction, and one square away in the other.

This piece has a long history, and appears in many chess variants. As such,
it's known under various names, including:

visiting all the squares on the board. 

#### Diamond

the %%PIECE%% will fille the entire board by following the Diamond Spiral.

it will visit all the squares on the board, in order of the values.

rather simple pattern.
