# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the moves from the
[*Queen*](queen.html) and the
[*Knight*](knight.html), which makes it a *Knighted Piece*. The
%%PIECE%% can either slide an unlimited amount of squares in one
the eight main directions, or jump to a square which is two squares
away in one orthogonal direction, and one square away in the other.

This piece has a long history, and appears in many chess variants. As such,
it's known under various names, including:

### Spiral

On the Spiral, since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html),
it can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and hence will follow the spiral,
visiting all the squares on the board. 

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, since %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html),
it can also move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html). Hence
it will visit all the squares on the board, in order of the values.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% fills the entire board, in a 
rather simple pattern.
