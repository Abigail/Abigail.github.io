# Amazon

The Amazon moves either like the [Queen](queen.html) or the
[Knight](knight.html).

On the Spiral, it can move like the [Wazir](wazir.html), and
hence will follow the spiral, visiting all the squares on the
board. 

On the Wedge, since it can move as the Queen, it will visit
all the squares on the board, in order of the values.
