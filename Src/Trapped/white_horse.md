The **White Horse** combines the movements of a vertical %%ROOK%%
with a forward %%BISHOP%%. That is, the **White Horse** either moves
an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares orthogonally forward or
backward, or an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares diagonally
forward.

The movements of the **White Horse** is the mirror image of the 
movements of the [*Whale*](whale.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

The **White Horse** will visit almost all squares in a wedge to the
right of the origin. As such, in the limit, the **White Horse** will
visit 25% of the squares on the board.

This mirrors the squares visited by the [*Whale*](whale.html).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **White Horse** escapes straight forward,
with an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **White Horse** escapes to the upper right, 
by visiting the three right most squares of each row. The six
step loop to move the piece to a square two forward-right results
in an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **White Horse** escapes by clinging to the
right edge of the Wedge, with an escape velocity of
\(\sqrt{2}\).
