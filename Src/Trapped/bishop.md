# Bishop

The **Bishop** (&#x2657;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in
each of the four diagonal directions, as long as the squares it
slides over are not occupied.

Due to its diagonal movement, the **Bishop** is *colour bound*: if it
starts a move on a dark square, it ends the move on a dark square.
And if it starts on a light square, it ends on a light square. As such,
the **Bishop** can only reach half the squares of the board.

In [Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi), the **Bishop**
is also known as the *Angle Mover* (&#x89d2;&#x884c;). It promotes
to a [*Dragon Horse* (&#x9f8d;&#x99ac;)](dragon_horse.html).

The **Bishop** is a [*Ferz*](ferz.html)*rider*, that is, it moves in the
same directions as the [*Ferz*](ferz.html), without a limit on
the number of squares it moves over (as long as the squares it
moves over are unoccupied).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Bishop** moves in a regular pattern. However, 
despite the possible moves of the **Bishop** being four fold symmetric,
the resulting pattern isn't, making the **Bishop** slightly interesting.

If we take the limit, we see that the **Bishop** will visit
\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) =
  \frac{5}{16} = 31.25 \%\) of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Bishop** quickly escapes to infinity, moving in
a stepwise pattern.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Bishop** escapes as well, keep to the right
edge of the Wedge.
