### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves in a regular pattern. However, 
despite the possible moves of the %%PIECE%% being four fold symmetric,
the resulting pattern isn't, making the %%PIECE%% slightly interesting.

If we take the limit, we see that the %%PIECE%% will visit
\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) =
  \frac{5}{16} = 31.25 \%\) of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% quickly escapes to infinity, moving in
a stepwise pattern.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes as well, keep to the right
edge of the Wedge.
