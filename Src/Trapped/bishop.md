# Bishop

The Bishop (&#x2657;) can slide an unlimited number of squares in
each of the four diagonal directions, as long as the squares it
slides over are not occupied. [Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi)
has the Angle Mover (&#x89d2;&#x884c;) which moves in the same
way (which is way the piece is also called a Bishop).

Due to its diagonal movement, the Bishop is *colour bound*: if it
starts a move on a dark square, it ends the move on a dark square.
And if it starts on a light square, it ends on a light square. As such,
the Bishop can only reach half the squares of the board.

The Bishop is a [Ferz](ferz.html)rider, that is, it moves in the
same directions as the [Ferz](ferz.html), without a limit on
the number of squares it moves over (as long as the squares it
moves over are unoccupied).

#### Spiral

On the Spiral, the Bishop moves in a regular pattern. However, 
despite the possible moves of the Bishop being four fold symmetric,
the resulting pattern isn't, making the Bishop slightly interesting.

If we take the limit, we see that the Bishop will visit
\(\frac{5}{16} = 31.25 \%\) of the squares on the board.

#### Wedge

On the Wedge, the Bishop quickly escapes to infinity, moving in
a stepwise pattern.
