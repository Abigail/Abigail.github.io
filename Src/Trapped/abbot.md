The **Abbot**
moves as either a [*Knight*](knight.html), or as a 
[*Bishop*](bishop.html), but then not more than four squares.
That is, the **Abbot** jumps to a square which is two away in
one orthogonal direction, and one away in the other, or which
slides up to four unoccupied squares in a diagonal direction.

This makes the **Abbot** a limited range [*Archbishop*](archbishop.html).

### Square

#### Square

On the Spiral Square, the **Abbot** gets trapped after 6,334 steps. This is 
only slightly sooner than the  [*Archbishop*](archbishop.html), which
gets trapped after 6,386 steps.

#### Diamond

It takes much longer for the **Abbot** to get trapped on the Diamond Square,
but eventually it does get trapped -- after 48,675,360 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Abbot** fills the entire board, using
a complicated unique pattern.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Abbot** fills the entire board, using
a complicated and unique pattern (but different from the Folded Wedge), with a
strong bias to the right hand side of the board.
