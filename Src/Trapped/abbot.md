# Abbot

The [**Abbot**](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised#Abbot)
moves as either a [*Knight*](knight.html), or as a 
[*Bishop*](bishop.html), but then not more than four squares.
This is not unlike the [*Archbishop*](archbishop.html), except
that the *Archbishop* does not have a limit on the number of
*Bishop* moves.

The pieces is used in [*Typhoon Chess*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised),
and [*Scirocco Chess*](#chess-v:invention/scirocco).


### Square

On the Square, the **Abbot** gets trapped after 6334 steps. This is 
only slightly sooner than the  [*Archbishop*](archbishop.html), which
gets trapped after 6386 steps.


### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Abbot** fills the entire board, using
a complicated unique pattern.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Abbot** fills the entire board, using
a complicated and unique pattern (but different from the Folded Wedge), with a
strong bias to the right hand side of the board.
