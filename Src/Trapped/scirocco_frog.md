# Frog (Scirocco)

The **Frog** either moves like the [*King*](king.html), the
[*Threeleaper*](threeleaper.html) or the [*Tripper*](tripper.html).
That is, the **Frog** jumps to a square which is either one or three
squares away, either orthogonally, or diagonally.

The **Frog** appeared in the
[original version of Scirocco Chess](#chess-v:large.dir/contest/scirocco.html),
but has been removed from the 
[*revived version*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco).

There is a different piece called [*Frog*](frog.html), known under
problemists, but it moves differently.


### Spiral

The **Frog** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it fills
the board by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Frog** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), so it fills
the board by following the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Frog** fills the board row by row. For each row,
the **Frog** will first visit every third square, going left to right,
then it goes right to left playing hopscotch visiting the remaining squares.
If all the squares on the row have been visited, the next row will be
visited.
