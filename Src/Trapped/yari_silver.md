The **Yari Silver** combines the movements of a forward %%FERZ%%,
a forward %%WAZIR%% and a backward %%ROOK%%. So, it either steps
one square forward (diagonally or orthogonally), and slides an
unlimited amount of unoccupied squares orthogonally backward.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Yari Silver** fills 25% of the squares: a wedge to
the right of the origin, with mostly vertical movements.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Yari Silver** moves straight forward, one square
per step. This gives an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Yari Silver** visits the three right most
squares of each row, escaping to the upper right. A six step loop
moves the pieces two squares forward and to the right. The escape
velocity is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Yari Silver** escapes by visiting the right most
square of each row, with an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{2}\).
