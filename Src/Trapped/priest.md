The **Priest** combines the movements of the [*Ferz*](ferz.html)
and the [*Knight*](knight.html). That is, it either jumps to a
square diagonally adjacent, or to a square which is two away in
one orthogonal direction, and one in the other.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Priest** circles the origin in a counter clockwise fashion
in an irregular way, getting trapped after 1,050 steps.

#### Diamond

The **Priest** quickly falls into a routine where it circles the
origin using only %%FERZ%% moves, with one %%KNIGHT%% move
per revolution. \(100\%\) of the squares on the board will be
visited.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Priest** uses a complicated pattern
to fill the entire board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Priest** uses a simple, slanted, pattern
to fill the entire board.
