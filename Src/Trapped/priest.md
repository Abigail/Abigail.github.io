# Priest

The **Priest** combines the movements of the [*Ferz*](ferz.html)
and the [*Knight*](knight.html). That is, it either jumps to a
square diagonally adjacent, or to a square which is two away in
one orthogonal direction, and one in the other.

The **Priest** is found in [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco),
where it promotes to the [*Duke*](duke.html).

Problemists may call this piece a *Prince*. The piece is also
known as a *Dullahan*.

### Spiral

in an irregular way, getting trapped after 1,050 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Priest** uses a complicated pattern
to fill the entire board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Priest** uses a simple, slanted, pattern
to fill the entire board.
