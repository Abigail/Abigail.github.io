# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves as the [*Knight*](knight.html), but it
may not jump. It moves one square orthogonally (which must
be unoccupied), then one square diagonally outward.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped quickly, after
no more than 28 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% uses a six step loop
to move two squares to the upper left. It escapes to
infinity by repeating this loop forever.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped even sooner
than on the Spiral. 12 steps, and it is trapped.
