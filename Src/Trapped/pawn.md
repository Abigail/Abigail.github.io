# Pawn &#x2659;

The Pawns movement is very limited. It can only move one square forward
(except the first move, where it has the option to move two squares
forward). Since we won't have other pieces on the board, it cannot move
diagonally to capture. Hence, the Pawn will always move forward, never
getting trapped; it just quickly escapes to infinity in a straight
line, regardless of the numbering used.
