# Pawn &#x2659;

The **Pawn** appears in [Chess](#wiki), 
[Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi), and many of its
variants.

In [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi), the piece is called the
*Swallow*.

In [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi), the piece is
called the **Chick**.

It's usually a humble piece, appearing multiple times on the board.
It's movements are complicated, but most movements we can ignore
for our investigations:

* In [Chess](#wiki) and its variants, the **Pawn** captures differently
  than it moves. However we can ignore capture moves.
* [Chess](#wiki) and its variants also have *en passant* moves, special
  capture moves. We will ignore those as well.
* In [Chess](#wiki) and its variants, it is typically the only piece
  which promotes (to a piece selected by the player). In
  [Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi), and Sh&#x14d;gi
  variants, the **Pawn** is one of the pieces which may promote.
  We will, however, ignore all promotions.
* In [Chess](#wiki) and many of its variants, the **Pawn** may optionally
  take a double (and in larger variants, a triple) step on its first
  move. For none of the numbering systems we use, the **Pawn** will
  make use of this option, so we can ignore this as well.

This makes that the **Pawn** is left with only one possible move:
one square forward.

### Promoting

**Pawns** typically promote. In Chess, they promote to a piece of the
players choice, but in other games, the pawn promotes to a fixed piece.

### Spiral and Wedge

On the Spiral and both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Pawn**
escapes to infinity in a straight line forward.
