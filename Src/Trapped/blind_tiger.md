The **Blind Tiger** moves one step in all directions (diagonally and
orthogonally), except straight forward. It is the mirror image of
the [*Drunk Elephant*](drunk_elephant.html) which moves in all
directions, except straight backwards.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Blind Tiger** fills the entire board, but it does so in an
unusual manner. It fills up the board in an expanding, roughly triangle
shaped pattern.
It adds three rows at the bottom, for each row at the right and left
side of the triangle. This is the mirror of the travel pattern
of the [*Drunk Elephant*](drunk_elephant.html).

#### Diamond

The **Blind Tiger** can move as the [*Blind Monkey*](blind_monkey.html).
Hence, it will follow the Diamond Spiral, and visit all the squares
on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Blind Tiger** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
causing the **Blind Tiger** to follow the numbers.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Blind Tiger** moves in the same way as
the [*King*](king.html) does, filling the wedge row by row, going from
right to left and left to right, with a small side step before
reaching the left end of each row.
