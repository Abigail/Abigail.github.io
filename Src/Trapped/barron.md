# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either slides an unlimited number of squares in any
of the four diagonal directions (like the %%BISHOP%%), or it makes
a non-jumping %%KNIGHT%%'s move (like the [*Bowman*](bowman.html)),
that is, it either moves one square
orthogonally followed by one square diagonally outward, or one square
diagonally outward, where in either case, the first square must be
unoccupied.

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped quickly, after no more than 160 steps. This
is about twice as many steps as it takes for the [*Bowman*](bowman.html)
to get trapped (after 78 steps), but the %%BISHOP%% does not get trapped
at all.

#### Diamond

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped even quicker on the Diamond Square: it is
trapped after 45 steps, which is 10 steps faster than the
[*Bowman*](bowman.html).

### Wedge

#### Folded

After no more than 19 steps, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped; 9 more staps
than the [*Bowman*](bowman.html).

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped after 105 steps.
