The **Heavenly Horse** leaps to a square which is two squares away forward or
backward, and one away to the right or left. This is equivalent to
half the moves of the %%KNIGHT%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Heavenly Horse** visits \(25\%\) of the squares,
in a diamond shaped pattern. The path it traces never intersects itself.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Heavenly Horse** traces the same path as on the
Square Spiral, but flipped horizontally. \(25\%\) of the squares
will be visited.

### Wedge

On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Heavenly Horse** quickly escapes
to the upper right. It uses a four step loop to move four squares
to the upper right, giving it an escape velocity of 
\(\sqrt{2}\). This is somewhat remarkable, as all the steps the
**Heavenly Horse** takes move to a square \(\sqrt{5}\) away.
