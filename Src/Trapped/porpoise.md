# Porpoise

The **Porpoise** moves one square either to the left or right.
This means, the **Porpoise** will always stay on the same row.

In %%WHALE_SHOGI%%, if the **Porpoise** gets captured, it turns
into a [*Killer Whale*](dragon_king.html?piece=killer_whale),
which can be dropped by the capturing player.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Porpoise** escapes to the right, by stepping
right on each step.

### Wedge

The **Porpoise** cannot move on either Wedge.
