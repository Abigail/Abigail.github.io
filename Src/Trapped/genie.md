# Genie

The **Genie** moves as the [*Queen*](queen.html), but only up
to three squares. That is, the **Genie** can slide up to three
unoccupied squares in any orthogonal or diagonal direction.

In [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the **Genie** is the
promoted [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html). In
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Genie** is
the promoted [*Salamander*](king.html?piece=salamander).

The *Harpy* in [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) and
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) (to which the
[*Dervish*](alibaba.html?piece=harpy) promotes) moves in the same
way as the **Genie**. In addition, the *Harpy* gives some addtional
movement powers to friendly which are in reach, but we can ignore
that in our setup. The **Harpy** cannot capture.

The *Typhoon*, as found in [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised)
moves in the same way as the **Genie**. In addition, it may capture
any enemy piece (so, up to three) it finds in its path (but we ignore
captures). The [*Cicada*](king.html?piece=cicada) promotes to the
*Typhoon*.
