# Genie

The **Genie** moves as the [*Queen*](queen.html), but only up
to three squares. That is, the **Genie** can slide up to three
unoccupied squares in any orthogonal or diagonal direction.

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the **Genie** is the
promoted [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html).

The *Harpy* in [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) (to which the
[*Dervish*](alibaba.html?piece=harpy) promotes) moves in the same
way as the **Genie**. In addition, the *Harpy* gives some addtional
movement powers to friendly which are in reach, but we can ignore
that in our setup. The **Harpy** cannot capture.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Genie** can move as the [*Wizar*](wizar.html),
so it will fill the board by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Genie** can move as the
[*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
so it will fill the board by following the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Genie** fills the board by following
a slightly slanted pattern.
