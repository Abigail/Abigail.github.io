The **Whale** combines the movements of a vertical %%ROOK%%
with a backward %%BISHOP%%. That is, the **Whale Horse** either moves
an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares orthogonally forward or
backward, or an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares diagonally
backward.

The movements of the **Whale** is the mirror image of the 
movements of the [*White Horse*](white_horse.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Whale** will visit almost all squares in a wedge to the
left of the origin. As such, in the limit, the **Whale** will
visit \(25\%\) of the squares on the board.

This mirrors the squares visited by the [*White Horse*](white_horse.html).

#### Diamond

The **Whale** makes half a revolution around the origin, then escapes
backward in a one step loop. The escape velocity is \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Whale** escapes to the upper left, 
by visiting the three left most squares of each row. A three step
loop brings the piece one square upward and to the left, for
an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat

On the Folded Wedge, the **Whale** escapes to the upper right, 
by visiting the three right most squares of each row. A three step
loop brings the piece one square upward and to the right, for
an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).
