# Flying Ox

The **Flying Ox** moves an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
diagonally (like the [*Bishop*](bishop.html), or orthogonally
forward or backward (like the forward/backward [*Rook*](rook.html)).

Compare with the [*Free Boar*](free_boar.html) which has the same
movements, rotated 90&deg;.

In [*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Flying Ox**
is the promoted [*Fire Horse*](fire_horse.html).

### Spiral

Despite the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) and the forward/backward 
[*Rook*](rook.html) not getting trapped, nor the [*Queen*](queen.html)
(which combines the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) and full [*Rook*](rook.html)),
the **Flying Ox** does get trapped, after 540 steps.
