# Diving Osprey

The **Diving Osprey** either moves up to four unoccupied squares
in any orthogonal direction, two squares in each of the four 
diagonal directions (it may jump over an occupied square), or
one square in one of the two diagonal forward directions.
In addition, it has some special capture movement (involving either
hopping, or not moving). It may also pass. But we only consider
non-capturing, non-passing moves).

In [*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Diving Osprey**
is the promoted [*Ferocious Leopard*](ferocious_leopard.html).

### Spiral

The **Diving Osprey** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it
will just follow the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Diving Osprey** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
so it will just follow the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Diving Osprey** fills the entire board
following a slightly interesting pattern, with a bias to the
right hand side of the board.
