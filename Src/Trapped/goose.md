# Goose (&#x9d08;)

The **Goose** either jumps to a square two away on a forward
diagonal, or to a square two straight backwards. This makes
the **Goose**
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound): if it
starts a move on a dark square, it ends the move on a dark square.
And if it starts on a light square, it ends on a light square. As such,
the **Goose** can only reach half the squares of the board.

The **Goose** is a piece found in [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi).
It's not present on the board at the start of the game -- it appears
when a [*Swallow*](pawn.html?piece=swallow) promotes.

### Spiral

The first 30 steps, the **Goose** bounces around, and then
gets into a pattern where it visits three squares (with one
unvisited square in between) every second row. Following this
pattern, the **Goose** escapes to the lower right.

### Wedge

On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Goose** visits the right most
square on each second row, and no other squares. It escapes hugging the
right edge of the Wedge.
