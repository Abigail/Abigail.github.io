The **Violent Ox** combines the movements of a vertical %%WAZIR%%
with a forward %%BISHOP%%. That is, the **Violent Ox** either moves
an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares diagonally forward or
steps a single square orthogonally forward or backward.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Violent Ox** circles the origin, in a clockwise
direction, then enters a three step loop to move on square
diagonally backwards. This gives it an escape velocity of
%%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Violent Ox** escapes in a
straight line forward, giving in an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Violent Ox** escapes to the upper right, 
by visiting the three right most squares of each row. The six
step loop to move the piece to a square two forward-right results
in an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Violent Ox** escapes by clinging to the
right edge of the Wedge, with an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2%%.
