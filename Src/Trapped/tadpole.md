# Tadpole

The **Tadpole** moves as either the [*Ferz*](ferz.html) or the
[*Threeleaper*](threeleaper.html). That is, it either moves one
square diagonally, or jumps to a square three orthogonally away.

The **Tadpole** is a piece from [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco),
and it is the piece the [*Pawn*](pawn.html) promotes to.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Tadpole** does not get trapped for its
first 20,000 steps. It's unclear whether it will stay untrapped
for ever.

### Wedge

On both the Folded Wedge, and the Flat Wedge, the **Tadpole** does
not get trapped for its first 20,000. And it doesn't seem that its
movement pattern is regular enough to determine it will never
get trapped.
