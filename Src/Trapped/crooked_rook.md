# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves like a %%ROOK%%, except that it turns 90&deg; at every
step. It always goes outward, so it alternates turning clockwise and
counterclockwise.

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% can move like the %%WAZIR%%, so on the Square Spiral, it
follows the spiral and visits all the squares.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% visits the same squares in the
same order as the %%BM%% does, so it follows the spiral and visits
all the squares. Note that the %%PIECE%% doesn't quite move in the
same way as the %%BM%%, as it can only move one step diagonally if
one of the neigbouring squares is unoccupied.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits all the squares in order,
making the same moves as the %%FC%% does. Due to the %%PIECE%% only
being able to make a diagonal step if one of the neighbouring squares
is unoccupied, we cannot say the %%PIECE%% can move in the same way
as the %%FC%% can.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits all the squares, using a
very simple pattern.
