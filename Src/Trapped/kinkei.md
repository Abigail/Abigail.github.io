The **Kinkei** alternates moving like the
[*Gold General*](gold_general.html) and the
(Sh&#x14d;gi) [*Knight*](shogi_knight.html). That is,
on odd moves the **Kinkei** moves on square orthogonally
or one square diagonally forward, and on even moves,
it leaps to a square two squares forward and one square
sideways.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Kinkei** escapes to the upper right, by
visiting two squares on each row and column (above and to the
right of the origin). By using a two step loop to move one square
the upper right, the escape velocity is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Square, the **Kinkei** uses a four step loop to
move two square upward, giving it an escape velocity of
\(\frac{1}{2}\). Only two files will be visited.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Kinkei** escapes straight ahead
by visiting all (except one) of the squares of the file
the origin is on, and all the squares on the file next to it.
It uses a four step loop to move two squares upward, for an
escape velocity of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Kinkei** escapes to the upper right
by visiting the two right most squares on each row. By using
a two step loop to move one square to the upper right, the
escape velocity is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
