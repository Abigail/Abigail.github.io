# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% leaps to a square which is either two squares away
sideways (right or left) and one square backward, or to a square
which is one away sideways and two squares forward. This half the
moves a [*Knight*](knight.html) has, and it mirrors the movements
of the [*Barc*](barc.html).
