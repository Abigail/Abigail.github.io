The **Crab** leaps to a square which is either two squares away
sideways (right or left) and one square backward, or to a square
which is one away sideways and two squares forward. This half the
moves a [*Knight*](knight.html) has, and it mirrors the movements
of the [*Barc*](barc.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

After visiting mostly squares above the origin, the **Crab** gets
trapped after 382 steps, which is more than double the number
of steps the [*Barc*](barc.html) uses.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Crab** gets trapped just a little sooner
than on the Square Spiral: after 315 steps it's trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Crab** gets trapped quickly, after 17 moves.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Crab** escapes using a 12-step loop to move itself
three square diagonally right-upward, resulting in an escape velocity
of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\).
