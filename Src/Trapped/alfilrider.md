# Alfilrider

The Alfilrider moves like a [Bishop](bishop.html), except that
it skips every other square. This means, on each move, it can
move an unlimited, *even* number of squares in each of the four
diagonal directions, under the condition each each second square
is empty (it can jump over occupied squares which are an odd
number of squares away from the starting position).

#### Spiral

On the Spiral, the Alfilrider moves in a similar way as the
[Bishop](bishop.html) does, but its path "blown up" by a factor
of two. As such, it will visit \(\frac{5}{64} = 7.8125 \%\)
of the squares on the board.

#### Wedge

On the Wedge, the Alfilrider escapes to infinity in a straight line.
