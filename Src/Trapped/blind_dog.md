### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Blind Dog** fills the entire board, in a unique
pattern.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Blind Dog** escapes upward, using the two
step loop to move to the square above it started the loop from.
This means its escape velocity is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Blind Dog** can moves as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
hence, it will follow the wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Blind Dog** will visit every square, mostly
filling rows right to left and left to right, with a small side step
just before reaching the left end of a row.
