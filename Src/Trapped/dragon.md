The **Dragon** either moves as a %%KNIGHT%% or a [*Pawn*](pawn.html).
That is, it either leaps to a square which is two away in one orthogonal
direction, and one in the other, or it moves to the square directly
in front of it.

This is a different piece than the [*Dragon*](dragon_a2c.html) from
%%GANYMEDE%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

It takes a while for the **Dragon** to get trapped, but eventually,
it does get trapped on step 94,632.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Dragon** gets trapped sooner than on the
Square Spiral, but it still takes 13,324 steps before it gets trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Dragon** gets trapped rather quickly: on step 42.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge however, the **Dragon** quickly settles into a pretty
pattern filling the entire board.
