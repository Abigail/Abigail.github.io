The **Side Boar** combines the movements of the %%KING%% and the
horizontal %%ROOK%%. That is, it either steps one square in any
of the eight cardinal directions, or slides an unlimited amount
of unoccupied squares to the left or right.

Compare with the [*Flying Stag*](flying_stag.html) which moves
the same way, but rotated by 90&deg;.
