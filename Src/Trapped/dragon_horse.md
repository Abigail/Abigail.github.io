# Dragon Horse

The **Dragon Horse** combines the moves of the [*King*](king.html)
and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html). That is, it either moves one
square orthogonally, or slides an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally.

In [Sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Shogi), the **Dragon Horse** is the 
promoted [*Bishop*](bishop.html).

The *Scirocco* moves in the same way as the **Dragon Horse**.
In [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the *Scirocco*
promotes to the [*Vulture*](dragon_horse.html?piece=vulture).
In [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the [*Alfil*](alfil.html)
promotes to the *Scirocco*.

The *Vulture* in [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) and 
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised)
also moves like the **Dragon Horse** (but it cannot capture on its diagonal
moves which are not direct adjacent to its starting square).
In [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) the
*Vulture* is the promoted [*Silver General*](silver_general.html).



### Spiral

The **Dragon Horse** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and
hence just follow the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Dragon Horse** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), and
hence just follow the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

Just like the [*King*](king.html), on the Flat Wedge, the
**Dragon Horse** just goes left to right, and right to left, with a
little sidestep before reaching the left hand side, filling the
entire board.
