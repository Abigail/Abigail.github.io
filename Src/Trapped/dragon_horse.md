The %%PIECE%% combines the moves of the [*Wazir*](wazir.html)
and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html). That is, it either moves one
square orthogonally, or slides an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally.

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and
hence just follow the Spiral.

#### Spiral

The %%PIECE%% can move as the %%BM%%, and hence, just follows
the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), and
hence just follow the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

Just like the [*King*](king.html), on the Flat Wedge, the
%%PIECE%% just goes left to right, and right to left, with a
little sidestep before reaching the left hand side, filling the
entire board.
