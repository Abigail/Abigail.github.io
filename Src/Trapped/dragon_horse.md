# Dragon Horse

The **Dragon Horse** combines the moves of the [*King*](king.html)
and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html). That is, it either moves one
square orthogonally, or slides an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally.

The **Dragon Horse** appears in Sh&#x14d;gi, when the
[*Angel Mover*](bishop.html?piece=angel_mover) promotes.

### Spiral

The **Dragon Horse** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and
hence just follow the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Dragon Horse** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), and
hence just follow the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

Just like the [*King*](king.html), on the Flat Wedge, the
**Dragon Horse** just goes left to right, and right to left, with a
little sidestep before reaching the left hand side.
