The **Northern Barbarian** either slides up to two unoccupied squares
orthogonally sideward (like a very limited horizontal %%ROOK%%),
or steps one square diagonally forward (like a forward %%FERZ%%),
or one square orthogonally forward or backward (like a vertical %%WAZIR%%).

It turns out that on all the boards we're looking at, that the
**Northern Barbarian** visits the same squares, using the same
patterns, as the [*Poisonous Snake*](poisonous_snake.html).
