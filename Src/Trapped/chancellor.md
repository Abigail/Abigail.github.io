# Chancellor

The Chancellor combines the movements of the [Knight](knight.html)
and [Rook](rook.html).

One the Spiral, the Chancellor can move as the [Wazir](wazir.html),
and hence visits all the squares by following the spiral.

On the Wedge, the Chancellor also fills the complete board, following
a simple pattern.
