# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either slides an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares in any of the four orthogonal directions (like a 
[*Rook*](rook.html)), or leaps to a square which is two away in
one orthogonal direction, one one in the other (like a
[*Knight*](knight.html)).

The %%PIECE%% is a common Fairy Piece, and has a long history.
It's known under many names, of which **Chancellor**, **Empress**
and **Marshal(l)** are the most frequently used.
