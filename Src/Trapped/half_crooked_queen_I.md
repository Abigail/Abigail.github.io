# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the moves of the [*Rook*](rook.html)
and the [*Crooked Bishop*](crooked_bishop.html). That is, it zigzags
diagonally outward, or slides orthogonally outwards.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% can move like the %%WAZIR%%, so
it follows the spiral and visits all the squares.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% can move like the %%BM%%, so
it follows the spiral and visits all the squares.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% can move like the %%FC%%, so
it follows the wedge and visits all the squares.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits all the squares by visiting
all the squares of each row, before moving on to the next row. This
is the same pattern the [*Crooked Queen*](crooked_queen.html) follows,
but different from the pattern the
[*Half Crooked Queen &#x2161;*](half_crooked_queen_II.html) follows.
