### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
following the Spiral, visiting all the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits all the squares, using
an interesting pattern. The pattern is remarkable in the sense it
has a bias to the left side of the wedge. Most filling pieces
either do not have a bias, or have one on the right hand side of
the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% follows a step wise pattern
on the right edge of the Wedge, escaping to infinity, visiting
only the two right most squares of each row.
