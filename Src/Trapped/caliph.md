# Caliph

The Caliph moves as either the [Wazir](wazir.html) or the [Alfil](alfil.html).

On the Spiral, it moves like the [Wazir](wazir.html), following
the Spiral, visiting all the squares on the board.

On the Wedge, the Caliph visits all the squares, in an interesting
pattern, with a bias to the left side of the board.
