# Caliph

The **Caliph** moves as either the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) or the
[*Alfil*](alfil.html). As such, it's a *compound leaper*, and 
is used by Problemists.

[*Overkill Ecumenical Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess)
has a [Bishop + Camel compound](oec_caliph.html) with the same name.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Caliph** moves like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
following the Spiral, visiting all the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Caliph** visits all the squares, using
an interesting pattern. The pattern is remarkable in the sense it
has a bias to the left side of the wedge. Most filling pieces
either do not have a bias, or have one on the right hand side of
the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Caliph** follows a step wise pattern
on the right edge of the Wedge, escaping to infinity, visiting
only the two right most squares of each row.
