The **Treacherous Fox** either jumps to a square one or two away
on each of the four diagonal directions (like a %%FERZ%% or an
%%ALFIL%%), jumps to a square one or two away orthogonally forward
or backward (like a vertical %%WAZIR%% or %%DABBABA%%), or it jumps
to a square three away either diagonally, forward or backward, then
slides zero or more unoccupied squares outward in the same direction.

Alternatively, one can describe the movement of the **Treacherous Fox**
as combining the movements of the %%BISHOP%% and the vertical %%ROOK%%,
with the option to jump over occupied squares not further than two away
from the starting square.

%%PIECE_INFO%%
  **Treacherous Fox**
& %%TAIKYOKU%%
& There are conflicting rules on how the **Treacherous Fox** moves. 
  See the [alternative way](flying_ox.html) this piece
  may move. %%WA_SHOGI%% also has a [*Treacherous Fox*](treacherous.html),
  but that moves differently. \\

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Treacherous Fox** doesn't get trapped in its first 10,000 moves
on the Spiral Square. But its movement does not seem regular enough to say
it will never get trapped. But it appears to visit all the squares.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral. the **Treacherous Fox** circles its point of
origin in a very regular fashion. It will visit all the squares
on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded Wedge

The **Treacherous Fox** doesn't get trapped in its first 10,000 moves
on the Folded Wedge. But its movement does not seem regular enough to say
it will never get trapped. But it appears to visit all the squares.

#### Flat Wedge

On the Folded Wedge, the **Treacherous Fox** visits all the squares
on the board, in a pattern with a slight bias to the upper right.
