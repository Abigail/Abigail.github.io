# Actor

The **Actor** is a piece from [*Overkill Ecumenical
Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess).

The **Actor** combines the movements of the
[*Bishop*](bishop.html), and the [*Gnu*](gnu.html).
(The [*Gnu*](gnu.html) combines
the movements of the [*Knight*](knight.html) and [*Camel*](camel.html).)


### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Actor** does not get trapped in its first 
20,000 steps. The pattern it follows is at that point still a
bit irregular, so it's unclear whether it will get trapped or not.


### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Actor** fills the entire Wedge, using
an interesting pattern. It fills the Wedge in a balanced way.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the entire board is filled as well, using a different
interesting pattern. The **Actor** has a slight bias to the right
hand side of the board.
