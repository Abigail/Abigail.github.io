# Hummingbird

The **Hummingbird** may move to a square one way orthogonally sidewards
or backwards (like a sidewards/backwards [*Wazir*](wazir.html)), or
two steps forward (like a forward [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html)).

Pieces which can move like the **Hummingbird** can be found in
several games:

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Hummingbird** gets trapped after 172 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Hummingbird** escapes to infinity by repeating
a three step pattern: two squares forward, one square backwards, and
one square to the left. This way, the three left most squares of each
row will be visited.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Hummingbird** follows the same pattern as on
the Folded Wedge, but mirrorred along the vertical axis.
