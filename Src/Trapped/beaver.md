forward (like a forward [*Wazir*](wazir.html) or a forward

or an unlimited of unoccupied squares orthogonally backward
(like a backward [*Rook*](rook.html)).

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the **Beaver** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the
**Beaver** will follow the Spiral, visiting every square on the
board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Beaver** escapes upward, using a 
two step loop to move on square upward. This means an escape
velocity of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Beaver** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), the
**Beaver** will follow the Folded Wedge, visiting every square on the
board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Beaver** uses a fairy unique and simple pattern
to to visit all the squares on the board.
