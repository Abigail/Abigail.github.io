### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Yaksha** gets trapped quickly.
It gets trapped after no more than 51 steps.

#### Diamond

The **Yaksha** escapes using a two step loop to move one
square forward, giving it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_2%%.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Yaksha** can move like the %%FC%%, and hence, visits
all the squares in order.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Yaksha** uses a 11 step loop to move
two squares diagonally forward. This gives it an escape velocity
of \(\frac{2 \sqrt{2}}{11}\).
on the board.
