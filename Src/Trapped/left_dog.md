The **Left Dog** either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares 
orthogonally forward (like a forward %%ROOK%%), or slides an unlimited
amount of unoccupied squares diagonally right-backward (like a right-backward
%%BISHOP%%), or steps one square orthogonally backward (like a backward
%%WAZIR%%).

This mirrors how the [*Right Dog*](right_dog.html) moves.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Left Dog** makes a few steps to the
right, then escapes orthogonally backwards, giving it an escape
velocity of \(1\).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Left Dog** escapes orthogonally
downward, with an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Left Dog** uses a three
step loop to move one square diagonally forward, for an escape
velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%. This mirrors the path the
[*Right Dog*](right_dog.html) takes.
