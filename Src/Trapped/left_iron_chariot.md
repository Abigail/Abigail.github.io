The **Left Iron Chariot** either steps one square in any of the
four orthogonal directions (like a %%WAZIR%%),
or slides an unlimited number of unoccupied squares diagonally
backward to the right (like a right backward %%BISHOP%%).

This mirrors the movement of the
[*Right Iron Chariot*](right_iron_chariot.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Left Iron Chariot** moves like the
%%WAZIR%%, visiting all the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Left Iron Chariot** will spiral clockwise
around the origin, skipping the square in a quadrant to the upper right
of the origin. Hence, it visits \(75\%\) of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Left Iron Chariot** get trapped after 13 steps,
more than twice the number of steps the
[*Right Iron Chariot*](right_iron_chariot.html) makes before it gets
trapped.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Left Iron Chariot** visits the two right
most squares of each row: a two step loop to move one square diagonally
forward. This gives it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_2%%.
