# Zebra &#x1F993;

The Zebra is one of the basic leapers, a (2, 3)-leaper. This means
that the Zebra jumps to a square which is two squares away in an orthogonal
direction, and 3 squares away into a direction perpendicural to the
first direction.

The Zebra will circle in an irregular way around the origin, with
some focus of activity on the diagonals.

The Zebra will get trapped after 4633 moves.
