The **Vertical Horse** either steps one square diagonally forward
(like a forward %%FERZ%%), steps one square orthogonally backward
(like a backward %%WAZIR%%), or slides an unlimited amount of 
unoccupied squares orthogonally forward (like a forward %%ROOK%%).

### Spiral

#### Square

After circling the origin once, the **Vertical Horse** uses a three
step loop to move one square diagonally backward. This gives it an
escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Vertical Horse** escapes with an 
escape velocity of \(1\): on a line straight forward.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge the **Vertical Horse** uses a six step loop to
move two squares diagonally forward, visiting the three right most
squares of each row. Its escape velocity is %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Vertical Horse** escapes with an escape velocity
of %%SQRT_2%% by visiting the right most square of every row.
