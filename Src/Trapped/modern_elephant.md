# Modern Elephant

The **Modern Elephant** moves as either the [*Ferz*](ferz.html) or
the [*Alfil*](alfil.html). The **Modern Elephant** jumps to a
square which is one or two away diagonally.

The *Zag* from [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), and
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) moves as
the **Modern Elephant**. The *Zag* can additionally capture
as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), but we ignore capture moves. The
*Zag* is the promoted [*Wazir*](wazir.html).

The *Raven* moves as the **Modern Elephant**, but has additional
capture moves (which we ignore here). In
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the [*Banner*](banner.html)
promotes to the *Raven*.

Since the **Modern Elephant** only makes diagonal moves, it is
*colourbound*.

Other names for the **Modern Elephant** include: *Archer*, 
*Falafel*, and *Ferfil*.
