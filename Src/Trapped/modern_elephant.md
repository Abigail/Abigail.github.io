# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves as either the [*Ferz*](ferz.html) or
the [*Alfil*](alfil.html). The %%PIECE%% jumps to a
square which is one or two away diagonally. This makes
%%PIECE%% %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% visits every second square 
from each row, travelling on a pattern not used by other pieces.
This way, it visits \(50\%\) of the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves like the %%FERZ%%, visiting
\(50\%\) of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity
using a step wise pattern on the right hand side of the board.
The four step loop to move to a square two forward and to the right
results in an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

#### Flat

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity
by visiting just the right most square of each row. This gives
an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{2}\).
