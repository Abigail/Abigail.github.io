# Crane (&#x9db4;)

The **Crane** either steps one square forward, either diagonally,
or straight ahead, or one square backwards, either diagonally
or straight backwards.

The **Crane** is a piece from [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi).

The *Ferocious Leopard* from *Chu Sh&#x14d;gi* moves in the same way.

### Spiral

The **Crane** visits all the squares on the Spiral. The squares visited
form an expanding hexagon, which is kind of unusual.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Crane** visits the right most three squares
of each row, escaping to infinity.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Crane** only visits the right most square
of each row, escaping to infinity quickly.
