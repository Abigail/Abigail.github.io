# Kightrider

A Knightrider moves one or more squares like a [Knight](knight.html),
where each subsequents moves must be in the same direction as the
first, and each square may not be occupied.

### Spiral

Surpringly, despite the Knightrider having more squares to move to in
each steps, the Knightrider gets trapped sooner than the
[Knight](knight.html). Where the [Knight](knight.html) gets trapped
in 2015 steps, the Knightrider gets trapped after 509 steps!

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the Knightrider gets trapped after 60 steps, which is
10 steps more than the [Knight](knight.html).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the Knightrider gets trapped after 22 steps, while
the [Knight](knight.html) escapes.
