The **Left Army** either slides an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally left-forward, or diagonally left-backward, (like a left
%%BISHOP%%), slides an unlimited number of unoccupied squares orthogonally
to the left (like a left %%ROOK%%), or steps one square in any of the
eight cardinal directions (like a %%KING%%).

The **Left Army** mirrors the movements of the
[*Right Army*](right_army.html).
