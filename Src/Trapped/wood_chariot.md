The **Wood Chariot** either steps one square diagonally forward to
the left, steps one square diagonally backward to the right (like
a limited %%FERZ%%), or slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
orthogonally forward or backward (like a vertical %%ROOK%%).

This mirrors how the [*Tile Chariot*](tile_chariot.html) moves.
