# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% alternates moving like the
[*Silver General*](silver_general.html) and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html),
starting with the former. So, on odd moves, the %%PIECE%% moves one
square diagonally, or one square orthogonally forward, and on even
moves, it slides over an unlimited number of unoccupied squares diagonally.
