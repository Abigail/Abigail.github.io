The **Ginkaku** alternates moving like the
[*Silver General*](silver_general.html) and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html),
starting with the former. So, on odd moves, the **Ginkaku** moves one
square diagonally, or one square orthogonally forward, and on even
moves, it slides over an unlimited number of unoccupied squares diagonally.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Ginkaku** gets trapped quickly, after 80 steps.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Square, the **Ginkaku** gets trapped quickly as well,
after 84 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Ginkaku** escapes to the upper right
by visiting two squares on each row: the right most, and the 
third square from the right. It's four step loop to move two
squares to the upper right, giving it an escape velocity of
\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Ginkaku** escapes by keeping to the 
right edge of the Wedge. This results in an escape velocity
of \(\sqrt{2}\).
