# Hawk

The Hawk moves as the [Alfil](alfil.html), the [Dabbaba](dabbaba.html),
the [Threeleaper](threeleaper.html) or the [Tripper](tripper.html).
That it, it steps two or three squares in each of the eight main
directions.

On both the Spiral and Wedge, the Hawk visits each square, in an 
interesting pattern.
