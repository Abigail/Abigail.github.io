The **Barc** leaps to a square which is either two squares away
sideways (right or left) and one square forward, or to a square
which is one away sideways and two squares backward. This half the
moves a [*Knight*](knight.html) has, and it mirrors the movements
of the [*Crab*](crab.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

After visiting mostly squares below the origin, the **Barc** gets
trapped after 154 steps, which is less than half the steps the
[*Crab*](crab.html) uses.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, it takes the **Barc** just over twice
the amount of steps to get trapped compared to the Square Spiral.
Bouncing around in a roughly triangle shaped area, the **Barc**
gets trapped after 325 steps.

### Wedge

On neither the Folded, nor the Flat Wedge, the **Barc** can move.
