# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% leaps to a square which is either two squares away
sideways (right or left) and one square forward, or to a square
which is one away sideways and two squares backward. This half the
moves a [*Knight*](knight.html) has, and it mirrors the movements
of the [*Crab*](crab.html).

### Spiral

After visiting mostly squares below the origin, the %%PIECE%% gets
trapped after 154 steps, which is less than half the steps the
[*Crab*](crab.html) uses.

### Wedge

On neither the Folded, nor the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% can move.
