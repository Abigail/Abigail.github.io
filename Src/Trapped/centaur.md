# Centaur

The **Centaur** moves as either the [*King*](king.html) or the
[*Knight*](knight.html). That is, it either moves to a square
one away orthogonally or diagonally, or to a square which is 
two away in one orthogonal direction and one in the other.

In [*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the
[*Bishop's Dog*](bishops_dog.html) promotes to the **Centaur**.

### Spiral

The **Centaur** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it will
just follow the Spiral and visit all the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Centaur** can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
so it will follow the Folded Wedge and visit all the squares.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Centaur** moves in a simple pattern, visiting
all the squares on the board, with a bias to the right hand side
of the board.
