The **Pheasant** either jumps two squares forward
(like a forward [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html)), or steps one
square diagonally backwards (like a backward %%FERZ%%).
This makes the %%PIECE%% %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Pheasant** escapes to infinity in a zig-zag
pattern, heading forward-left. The two step loop which moves the
piece one square forward-left means an escape velocity of
\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Pheasant** visits half the squares which
are below the origin (or on the same row), and less than half the
squares on the two rows above the origin. No squares further forward
will be visited, hence, in the limit, the **Pheasant** vists \(25\%\)
of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Pheasant** escapes to infinity in the
same way as on the Spiral, hence, with an escape velocity of
\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Pheasant** escapes to infinity in a zig-zag
pattern, heading forward-left. This pattern is a mirror image
from the pattern formed on the Folded Wedge. Hence, the escape
velocity is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
