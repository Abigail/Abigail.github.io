# Pheasant (&#x96c9;)

The **Pheasant** either jumps two squares forward, or steps one
square diagonally backwards. The **Pheasant** is
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound): if it
starts a move on a dark square, it ends the move on a dark square.
And if it starts on a light square, it ends on a light square. As such,
the **Pheasant** can only reach half the squares of the board.

The **Pheasant** is a piece found in [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Pheasant** escapes to infinity in a zig-zag
pattern, heading forward-left.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Pheasant** escapes to infinity in the
same way as on the Spiral.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Pheasant** escapes to infinity in a zig-zag
pattern, heading forward-left. This pattern is a mirror image
from the pattern formed on the Folded Wedge.
