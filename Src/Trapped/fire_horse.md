# Fire Horse

The **Fire Horse** either moves an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares forward (like the [*Rook*](rook.html)), or to a square
which is two backwards and one sideward, or one backward and two
sideways (so, like a backward [*Knight*](knight.html)).

In [*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Fire Horse**
promotes to the [*Flying Ox*](flying_ox.html).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Fire Horse** gets trapped quickly, after 45 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Fire Horse** escapes to infinity by visiting
the four left most squares of each row. The pattern consist of repeating
the following four moves (starting from a right most square of a row):
three times a step forward, then a Knight's move backward (to a square
two back, and one to the right). This lands the piece on the right most
square of the row one ahead of the starting row, so the pattern can
repeat.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Fire Horse** travels using the same pattern
as it does on the Folded Wedge, but mirrored along the vertical axis.
Not many other pieces have this mirror like behaviour.
