The **Yari Gold** either moves as a [*Gold General*](gold_general.html)
or as a backward [*Rook*](rook.html). That is, the **Yari Gold** either
moves one square forward (orthogonally or diagonally), one square
orthogonally sideways (right or left), or an unlimited number of 
unoccupied squares backward.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Spiral, the **Yari Gold** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
so it will just follow the spiral.

#### Diamond

The **Yari Gold** uses a two step loop to move one square forward,
with an escape velocity of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Yari Gold** can move like the
[*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
so it will just follow the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Yari Gold** will visit all the squares,
going left to right and right to left on the rows, with a small
side step just before reaching the left end of a row.
