The **Goat** either jumps to a square one away diagonally
(like the [*Ferz*](ferz.html)), or two away orthogonally
(like the [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html)). This makes the
%%PIECE%% %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Goat** follows the spiral, but it visits only every second square.
Hence, it visits \(50\%\) of the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

The **Goat** moves exactly as the %%FERZ%% does on the Diamond Spiral,
visiting half the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Goat** follows the Folded Wedge, visiting every second square.

#### Flat

The **Goat** fills half the board, row by row, visiting every second
square. Before reaching the left side of the board, a small side step
is taken.
