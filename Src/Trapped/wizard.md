# Wizard

The Wizard moves as either the [Ferz](ferz.html), or the 
[Camel](camel.html). This makes the Wizard a colour-bound piece.
The piece is found in [Omega Chess](#wiki).

It is unclear whether the Wizard gets trapped on the Spiral.

On the Wedge, the Wizard follows a pretty pattern, visiting 50% 
of the squares.
