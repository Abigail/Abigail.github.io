# Wizard

The **Wizard** moves as either the [*Ferz*](ferz.html), or the 
[*Camel*](camel.html). That is, the **Wizard** either steps to
a square one away in a diagonal direction, or to a square which
is three away in one orthogonal direction, and one away in the other.
This makes the **Wizard** a colour-bound piece.

The piece is found in [*Omega Chess*](#wiki).

### Spiral

It is unclear whether the **Wizard** gets trapped on the Spiral. It does
not get trapped for the first 20,000 steps, but its travelling pattern
is irregular.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Wizard** follows a pretty pattern, visiting 50% 
of the squares.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Wizard** follows a striped pattern, visiting 50%
of the squares.
