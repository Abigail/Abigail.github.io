# Sorcerer

The **Sorcerer** moves up to two unoccupied squares in each of the
eight main directions. It cannot capture this way, instead, if it lands
adjacent to an enemy piece in the same direction as it moves, it capture
this piece (and any consecutive piece in the same direction). However,
we do ignore captures.

In [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the [*Beaver*](beaver.html)
promotes to the **Sorcerer**.

### Spiral

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Sorcerer** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
and as such, if will follow the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Sorcerer** will visit all the squares.
