The **Emperor** either moves as a [*Knight*](knight.html), or as
a [*Queen*](queen.html), but not more than two squares. That is,
the %%PIECE%% can reach every square of a 5x5 square with where
the %%PIECE%% starts in the center -- but it can be blocked when
trying to reach the corners (or centers of the edges) of the 5x5
square.

The related game of %%SCIROCCO%% has a piece named 
[*Emperor*](champion.html), but it moves differently.
