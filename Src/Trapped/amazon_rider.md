# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the moves of the [*Queen*](queen.html)
and the [*Nightrider*](nightrider.html), making it a very
strong piece (even stronger than the [*Amazon*](amazon.html).

### Spiral

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it
just follows the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), so it
just follows the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% visits all the squares of the Flat Wedge using the
same pattern the [*Amazon*](amazon.html) does.
