# Wagon

The **Wagon** slides an unlimited amout of unoccupied squares
in any orthogonal direction, but it may not land on a square
next to the starting square (but the square must be unoccupied
if the **Wagon** wants to move in that direction).

The **Wagon** in [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco),
and [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised)promotes
to the [*Spider*](spider.html).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Wagon** moves in the same way as
the [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html), visiting only those
squares which are both on even rows and even files.
This follows the Spiral, blown up by a factor of two,
visiting 25% of the board.

### Wedge

On both the Folded Wedge and Flat Wedge, on each even row the **Wagon**
visits the third square from the right, and the right most square,
before jumping up two rows, escaping to infinity.
