### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity on a 45&deg; angle,
visiting three squares on each row, before moving one row up and
one column back. This four step loop to move one square to the
upper right means an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% uses a two step loop to move
one square upwards. This gives in an escape velocity of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% has exactly the minimum movements
available to follows the numbers in exact order.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits almost every square of the
board, filling the board row by row, to only skip the two left-most
squares on every second row.
