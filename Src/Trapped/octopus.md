# Octopus

The **Octopus** first steps one square diagonally (like the
[*Ferz*](ferz.html), then slides zero or more squares 
orthogonally outward (like the [*Rook*](rook.html)).

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the **Octopus** is
a promoted [*Chariot*](chariot.html).

### Spiral

After bouncing around for the first couple of steps, all 
squares the **Octopus** vists on the two main diagonals.
This makes it an escaping piece, but one which escapes 
in multiple directions; a feat we have not seen before.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Octopus** gets trapped on step 7!

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Octopus** only visits the right most
square of each row, escaping by sticking to the boundary.
