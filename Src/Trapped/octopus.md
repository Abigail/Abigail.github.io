# Octopus

The **Octopus** first steps one square diagonally (like the
[*Ferz*](ferz.html), then slides zero or more squares 
orthogonally outward (like a [*Rook*](rook.html).

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the **Octopus** is
a promoted [*Chariot*](chariot.html).

### Spiral

After bouncing around for the first couple of steps, all 
squares the **Octopus** vists on the two main diagonals.
This makes it an escaping piece, but one which escapes 
in multiple directions; a feat we have not seen before.
