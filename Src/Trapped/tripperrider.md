# Tripperrider

On each move the Tripperrider moves one or more steps the
[Tripper](tripper.html) makes, provided it doesn't turn
and each square it moves over is unoccupied. (So, it can
move six squares diagonally if the third square is unoccupied,
but the first, second, fourth or fifth square may be occupied).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the Tripperrider moves in a similar way as the
[Bishop](bishop.html) does, but its path "blown up" by a factor
of three. As such, it will visit
\(\frac{1}{18} \cdot (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) =
  \frac{5}{144} = 3.47\overline{2}\%\)
of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the Tripperrider escapes to infinity, using
a zigzag pattern on the right hand side of the Wedge.

#### Flat

On Flat Wedge, the Tripperrider escapes
to infinity in a straight line, hugging the right side of the Wedge.
