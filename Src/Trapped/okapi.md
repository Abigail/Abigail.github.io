The **Okapi** moves like either the %%KNIGHT%%
or the [*Zebra*](zebra.html). That is, the **Okapi** jumps to
a square which is two away in one orthogonal direction, and
one or three away in the other.

### Spiral

#### Square

It takes almost a million steps, but the **Okapi** gets trapped
after 947,668 steps.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, it's not clear whether the **Okapi** gets
trapped or not. It does not get trapped for its first billion steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, it's not clear whether the **Okapi** gets
trapped or not. It does not get trapped for its first billion steps.

#### Flat

After almost 300 steps, the **Okapi** enters a four step loop which
brings it one square forward and to the right. This gives it an
escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\).
