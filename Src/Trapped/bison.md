it's not before step 844,094 before it gets trapped.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Bison** does not get trapped for its
first billion steps, but it's unclear whether it will remain free
forever.

### Wedge

On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Bison** does not get trapped
for its first billion steps, but it's unclear whether it will
never get trapped.
