# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves to the same squares as the %%KNIGHT%% moves
to, but it cannot jump. It either moves one square orthogonally,
then one square diagonally outward, or one square diagonally,
then one square orthogonally outward. The first square may not
be occupied.

This combines the movement of the [*Mao*](mao.html) and the
[*Moa*](moa.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped after 78 steps, which is a little bit
more than the [*Mao*](mao.html) or [*Moa*](moa.html), but a lot
less than the %%KNIGHT%%.

#### Diamond

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped faster than on the Square Spiral:
after 55 steps, it is trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Only 10 steps, and the %%PIECE%% is trapped.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% moves in the same way as
on the Folded Wedge, and hence gets trapped after 10 steps.
