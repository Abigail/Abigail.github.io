# Champion

The **Champion** moves as either the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the 
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html) or the [*Alfil*](alfil.html). This means,
the **Champion** jumps two squares away diagonally or one or
two squares orthogonally,

The piece is found in [*Omega Chess*](#wiki).

In *Carrera's Chess*, dating from the early
17<sup>th</sup> century, there was also a piece named *Champion*,
but this was a [Rook + Knight compound](chancellor.html).

### Spiral

Since the **Champion** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), it
will follow the Spiral, visiting all squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Champion** almost follows the path of the Wedge,
except for making swapping two squares at each new row. It still visits
each square on the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, for each row, the **Champion** first visits all the even
squares (going left to right), then all the odd squares (going right to left).
It then moves the the next row.
