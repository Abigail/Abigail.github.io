# Champion

The Champion moves as either the [Wazir](wazir.html), the 
[Dabbaba](dabbaba.html) or the [Alfil](alfil.html). The
piece is found in [Omega Chess](#wiki).

Since the Champion can move as the [Wazir](wazir.html), it
will follow the Spiral, visiting all squares on the board.

On the Wedge, it almost follows the path of the Wedge, except
for making swapping two squares at each new row. It still visits
each square on the board.
