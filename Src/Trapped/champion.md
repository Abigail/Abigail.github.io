### Spiral

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), it
will follow the Spiral, visiting all squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% almost follows the path of the Wedge,
except for making swapping two squares at each new row. It still visits
each square on the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, for each row, the %%PIECE%% first visits all the even
squares (going left to right), then all the odd squares (going right to left).
It then moves the the next row.
