The **Champion** moves as either the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the 
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html) or the [*Alfil*](alfil.html). This means,
the **Champion** jumps two squares away diagonally or one or
two squares orthogonally,

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the **Champion** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), it
will follow the Spiral, visiting all squares on the board.

#### Diamond

The **Champion** visits all the squares on the board, in a pretty unique
way. While most pieces which don't get trapped soon either circle the
origin mainly clockwise or mainly counterclockwise, the **Champion** makes
alternates making a single, full clockwise rotation and making a single, full
counterclockwise rotation, switching directions directly below the origin.
The **Champion** is tracing out an expanding square, with sharp edges.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Champion** almost follows the path of the Wedge,
except for making swapping two squares at each new row. It still visits
each square on the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, for each row, the **Champion** first visits all the even
squares (going left to right), then all the odd squares (going right to left).
It then moves the the next row.
