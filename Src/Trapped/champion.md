# Champion

The **Champion** moves as either the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the 
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html) or the [*Alfil*](alfil.html). The
piece is found in [*Omega Chess*](#wiki).

In *Carrera's Chess*, dating from the early
17<sup>th</sup> century, there was also a piece named *Champion*,
but this was a [Rook + Knight compound](chancellor.html).


Since the Champion can move as the [Wazir](wazir.html), it
will follow the Spiral, visiting all squares on the board.

On the Wedge, it almost follows the path of the Wedge, except
for making swapping two squares at each new row. It still visits
each square on the board.
