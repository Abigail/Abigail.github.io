# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% is  a [*(1,3)-leaper*](leapers.html#basic_leapers). This means
that the %%PIECE%% jumps to a square which is three squares away in
one orthogonal
direction, and one square away into a direction perpendicular to the
first direction.

This makes the %%PIECE%% %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.
