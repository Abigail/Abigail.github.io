The **Camel** is  a [*(1,3)-leaper*](leapers.html#basic_leapers). This means
that the **Camel** jumps to a square which is three squares away in
one orthogonal
direction, and one square away into a direction perpendicular to the
first direction.

This makes the **Camel** %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Camel** will circle in an irregular way around the origin, in
the opposite direction from the Spiral; roughly tracing out a square.
The **Camel** will get trapped after 3,722 steps.

#### Diamond

Surprisingly, the **Camel** will get trapped in as many steps as
the [*Knight*](knight.html) on the Square Spiral: 2,015 steps!

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Camel** gets trapped much sooner than on
the Spiral, after no more than 342 steps, the **Camel** is trapped.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, it takes much longer than on the Folded Wedge for
the **Camel** to get trapped: 2,401 steps.
