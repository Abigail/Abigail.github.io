# Camel &#x1F42B;

The **Camel** is one of the basic leapers, a (3, 1)-leaper. This means
that a Camel jumps to a square which is three squares away in an orthogonal
direction, and one square away into a direction perpendicular to the
first direction.

This makes that the **Camel** is
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound).
The **Camel** can only reach half the squares on the board.

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) and
[*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Camel** promotes
to the [*Squirrel*](squirrel.html).

### Spiral

The **Camel** will circle in an irregular way around the origin, in
the opposite direction from the Spiral; roughly tracing out a square.
The **Camel** will get trapped after 3,722 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Camel** gets trapped much sooner than on
the Spiral, after no more than 342 steps, the **Camel** is trapped.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, it takes much longer than on the Folded Wedge for
the **Camel** to get trapped: 2,401 steps.
