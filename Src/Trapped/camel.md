# Camel &#x1F42B;

The Camel is one of the basic leapers, a (1, 3)-leaper. This means
that a Camel jumps to a square which is one square away in an orthogonal
direction, and 3 squares away into a direction perpendicural to the
first direction.

This makes that the Camel is [colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound).
A Camel can only reach half the squares on the board.

The Camel will circle in an irregular way around the origin, in
the opposite direction from the Spiral; roughly tracing out a square.
The Camel will get trapped after 3722 moves.
