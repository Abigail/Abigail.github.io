# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either moves up to four unoccupied squares diagonally
(like a restricted %%BISHOP%%), jumps to a square two away
in any orthogonal direction (like a [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html)),
or one square orthogonally forward (like a forward %%WAZIR%%).

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% doesn't get trapped for its first
billion steps. It doesn't quite settle into a repeating pattern, so
while it looks like it doesn't get trapped, we don't know for sure.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% will visit all the squares on
the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits very odd square of each
row, so in the limit, it will visit \(50\%\) of the squares on the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% uses an interesting pattern making
multiple sweeps over each row to visit all the squares.
