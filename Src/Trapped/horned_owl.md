# Horned Owl

The **Horned Owl** either moves up to four unoccupied squares diagonally
(like a restricted [*Bishop*](bishop.html)), jumps to a square two away
in a orthogonal direction, or one square orthogonally forward.
Additionally, the **Horned Owl** has some hopping capture moves and 
some non-moving captures available, as well as the option to pass. 
But we can ignore those.

In [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the
[*Gold General*](gold_general.html) promotes to the **Horned Owl**.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Horned Owl** doesn't get trapped for its first
20,000 steps. It doesn't quite settle into a repeating pattern, so
while it looks like it doesn't get trapped, we don't know for sure.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Horned Owl** visits very odd square of each
row, so in the limit, it will visit half of the squares on the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Horned Owl** uses an interesting pattern making
multiple sweeps over each row to visit all the squares.
