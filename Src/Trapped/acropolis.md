The **Acropolis** combines the movements of the
[*Rook*](rook.html), and the [*Gnu*](gnu.html). (The [*Gnu*](gnu.html) combines
the movements of the [*Knight*](knight.html) and [*Camel*](camel.html).)

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the **Acropolis** can move as the [*Rook*](rook.html), and hence,
as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the **Acropolis** fills the entire 
board by just following the Spiral.

#### Diamond

It takes a long time, but the **Acropolis** does get trapped on the
Diamond Spiral. After 4,487,928 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Acropolis** fills the entire Folded Wedge, in an interesting pattern,
going from one side to another, bouncing back and forth between
three rows at a time.

#### Flat

The **Acropolis** also fills the entire Flat Wedge, using a different,
but also interesting, pattern. It has a bias the right hand side of
the Wedge.
