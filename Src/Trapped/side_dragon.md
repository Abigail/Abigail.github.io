except that it may not go backward.

On the Square Spiral, the **Side Dragon** uses a four step loop to
move on square diagonally forward, giving it an escape velocity
of %%SQRT_2_OVER_4%%.

#### Diamond

line to the right, with an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Side Dragon** visits half the squares
of each row, alternating visiting the left and right half of
each row. \(50\%\) of the squares will be visited.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Side Dragon** visits the two right most
squares of each row, which gives it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_2%%.
