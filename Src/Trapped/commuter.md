# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% is a [(4,4)-leaper](leapers.html#basic_leapers).
That is, it jumps to a square
which is 4 squares away in any diagonal direction. Since it only
moves on diagonals, the %%PIECE%% is %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

### Spiral

The %%PIECE%% follows the same path as the [*Ferz*](ferz.html),
except blown up by a factor of three. As such, it visits 
\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4^2} = \frac{1}{32} = 3.125\%\)
of the squares.

### Wedge

On both the Folded and Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% follows a path along the
right edge of the Wedge, visiting the right most square of each fourth row.
