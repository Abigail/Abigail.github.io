# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the movements of the
[*Queen*](queen.html), and the [*Camel*](camel.html). That is, 
the **Acme** can either slide an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares in each of the eight main directions (orthogonal and
diagonal), or leap to a square which is three squares away in
one orthogonal direction, and one square away in the other.
