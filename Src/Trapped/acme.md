# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the movements of the
[*Queen*](queen.html), and the [*Camel*](camel.html). That is, 
the **Acme** can either slide an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares in each of the eight main directions (orthogonal and
diagonal), or leap to a square which is three squares away in
one orthogonal direction, and one square away in the other.

### Spiral

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the %%PIECE%% fills the entire 
board by just following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), the %%PIECE%% fills the entire 
board by just following the values of the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% fills the Flat Wedge using a simple pattern, with a
bias to the right hand side.
