# Acme

The **Acme** is a piece from [*Overkill Ecumenical
Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess).

The **Acme** combines the movements of the
[*Queen*](queen.html), and the [*Camel*](camel.html). That is, 
the **Acme** can either slide an unlimited number of unoccupied
squares in each of the eight main directions (orthogonal and
diagonal), or leap to a square which is three squares away in
one orthogonal direction, and one square away in the other.

### Spiral

Since the **Acme** can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the **Acme** fills the entire 
board by just following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Acme** can move as the [*Queen*](queen.html), and hence,
as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), the **Acme** fills the entire 
board by just following the values of the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

The **Acme** fills the Flat Wedge using a simple pattern, with a
bias to the right hand side.
