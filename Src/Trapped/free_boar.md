# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
diagonally (like the [*Bishop*](bishop.html)), or orthogonally
leftward or rightward (like the sidewards [*Rook*](rook.html)).

Compare with the [*Flying Ox*](flying_ox.html) which has the same
movements, rotated 90&deg;.

### Spiral

Despite the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) and the sidewards
[*Rook*](rook.html) not getting trapped, nor the [*Queen*](queen.html)
(which combines the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) and full [*Rook*](rook.html)),
the %%PIECE%% does get trapped, after 251 steps. This is less than
half the steps the [*Flying Ox*](flying_ox.html) takes before getting
trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded Wedge

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
hence the %%PIECE%% follows the Folded Wedge, visiting all the
squares on the board.

#### Flat Wedge

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% follows a simple pattern, visiting
every square on the board, with a strong bias to the right.
