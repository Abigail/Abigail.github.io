The (Sh&#x14d;gi) **Knight** jumps to a square which is two squares ahead,
and one square sideways. These are the two most forward moves the
%%KNIGHT%% from (Western) Chess has.

The %%KNIGHT%% from Western Chess moves differently.
*Cavalry Chess* also has a piece called a *Knight*, but that moves 
like the [*Buffalo*](buffalo.html); this game also has a piece called
*Knight King* which moves like a [*Centaur*](centaur.html).
The [*Knight*](knight_euro.html) in %%EURO_SHOGI%% also moves
differently.

The **Knight** escapes in a straight, slanted, line to infinity, with
an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{5}\).

In two steps, it moves four squares ahead, for an escape velocity of \(2\).

### Wedge

On both the Folded and the Flat Wedge, the **Knight**
escapes to infinity using the same line as the Square Spiral.
The escape velocity is \(\sqrt{5}\).
