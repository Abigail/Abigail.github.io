The (Sh&#x14d;gi) **Knight** jumps to a square which is two squares ahead,
and one square sideways. These are the two most forward moves the
%%KNIGHT%% from (Western) Chess has.

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Knight** escapes in a straight, slanted, line to infinity, with
an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{5}\).

#### Diamond

The **Knight** escapes straight ahead, bouncing between two files.
In two steps, it moves four squares ahead, for an escape velocity of \(2\).

### Wedge

On both the Folded and the Flat Wedge, the **Knight**
escapes to infinity using the same line as the Square Spiral.
The escape velocity is \(\sqrt{5}\).
