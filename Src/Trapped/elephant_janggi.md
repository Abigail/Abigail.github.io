The **Elephant** moves as a blocking [*Zebra*](zebra.html). That is,
the **Elephant** moves one square orthogonally, and then two squares
diagonally outward -- and those squares it moves over must be
unoccupied. (Unlike the [*Zebra*](zebra.html) which can leap
to the same squares as the **Elephant** can, but which cannot be
blocked).

This is the **Elephant** from %%JANGGI%%. There are pieces named
*Elephant* in other games, but they move differently:
[D&#x14d;butsu Sh&#x14d;gi](ferz.html), [Xiangqi](elephant.html), and
[Wolf Chess](amazon_rider.html).

There is also a piece called [*Elephant Prince*](king.html) in
%%TYPHOON%%. The [*Alfil*](alfil.html) is sometimes called *Elephant*,
as it's derived from the Persian word for elephant.
