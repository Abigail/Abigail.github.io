# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves as a blocking [*Zebra*](zebra.html). That is,
the %%PIECE%% moves one square orthogonally, and then two squares
diagonally outward -- and those squares it moves over must be
unoccupied. (Unlike the [*Zebra*](zebra.html) which can leap
to the same squares as the %%PIECE%% can, but which cannot be
blocked).
