The **Vertical Pup** either steps one square orthogonally or diagonally
backwards (like a backward %%WAZIR%% or a backward %%FERZ%%), or slides an
unlimited amount of unoccupied squares orthogonally forward (like
a forward %%ROOK%%).

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Vertical Pup** visits almost all squares
in a wedge left of the origin. \(25\%\) of the squares will be visited.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Vertical Pup** escapes orthogonally 
backward, with an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge the **Vertical Pup** uses a three step loop
to move on square diagonally forward, for an escape velocity of
%%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge the **Vertical Pup** uses a three step loop
to move on square diagonally forward, for an escape velocity of
%%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%. The movement pattern is a mirror image of
how the piece moves on the Folded Wedge.
