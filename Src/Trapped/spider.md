# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% first moves one square orthogonally (like the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html)), then zero or more squares diagonally
outwards (like the [*Bishop*](bishop.html)).

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so
it just follows to Spiral.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% follows a unique pattern
to eventually visit \(100\%\) of the squares on the board, but
it has a strong bias on which squares to visit first.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped after no more than 10 steps!

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity by
visiting the two right most squares on each row, with
as escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
