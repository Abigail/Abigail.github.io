# Spider

The **Spider** first moves one square orthogonally (like the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html)), then zero or more squares diagonally
outwards (like the [*Bishop*](bishop.html)).

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco), the **Spider** is
the promoted [*Wagon*](wagon.html).

### Spiral

The **Spider** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so
it just follows to Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Spider** gets trapped after no more than 10 steps!

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Spider** escapes to infinity by
visiting the two right most squares on each row.
