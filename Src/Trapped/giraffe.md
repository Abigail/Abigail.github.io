# Giraffe

The **Giraffe** is a (4, 1)-leaper. That is, from its starting square,
it jumps to a square which is four away in one orthogonal direction,
and one in the other.

There is also a piece called *Giraffe* in
[D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi), but it moves
like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html?piece=dobutsu_giraffe).

### Spiral

The **Giraffe** moves irregular on the Spiral, eventually getting
trapped. This, however, only happens on step 13,102.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Giraff** gets trapped much faster than
on the Spiral: after a mere 114 steps, it gets trapped.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Giraff** gets trapped even after; it makes
94 steps, and gets trapped.
