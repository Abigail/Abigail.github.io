The **Guardian of the Gods** slides up to three unoccupied squares
in any of the four orthogonal directions. This makes it a limited
%%ROOK%%.

Compare with the [*Chariot*](chariot.html), which may slide up to
four unoccupied squares, and the [*Donkey*](donkey.html), which
slides up to two unoccupied squares.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Guardian of the Gods** can move like the
%%WAZIR%%, so it just follows the Spiral, visiting all the squares in order.

#### Diamond

The **Guardian of the Gods** gets trapped after no more than 129 steps.
This is slightly more than the [*Chariot*](chariot.html), which gets
trapped after 112 steps. The [*Donkey*](donkey.html) on the other hand
does not get trapped, and visits \(81.25\%\) of the squares.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Just like the %%ROOK%%, the [*Chariot*](chariot.html), and the
%%WAZIR%%, the **Guardian of the Gods** gets trapped after 6 steps.
Which is one more than it takes the [*Donkey*](donkey.html) to get
trapped.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Guardian of the Gods** visits the two
right most squares of every row, escaping with a velocity of
%%SQRT_2_OVER_2%%.
