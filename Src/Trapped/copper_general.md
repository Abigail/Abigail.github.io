The **Copper General** either moves one square forward (either orthogonally
or diagonally), or one square orthogonally backward. Hence, it 
combines the movements of a vertical [*Wazir*](wazir.html) and
a forward [*Ferz*](ferz.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Copper General** circles the origin once,
then escapes to bottom right, using a three step loop to
move one square to the bottom right. This gives it an 
escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Copper General** escapes straight upward,
move one square up at each step. This gives it an escape 
velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded Wedge

On the Folded Wedge, the **Copper General** visits the three right
most squares of each row, escaping to infinity to the upper
right. It uses a six step loop to move two squares to the
upper left, giving it an escape velocity of
\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat Wedge

On the Flat Wedge, the **Copper General** visits the right most
square of the each row, giving it an escape velocity of
\(\sqrt{2}\).
