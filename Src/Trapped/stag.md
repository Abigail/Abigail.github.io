# Stag

The **Stag** is a (4, 2)-leaper; that is, on each move it moves
to a square which is four away in one orthogonal direction, and
two away in the other. (It moves in the same directions as the
[*Knight*](knight.html), but twice as far).

This makes the **Stag** not only *colourbound*, it means it can
only reach squares which are both on even row, and an even file.
Hence, it can only reach 11.1% of the squares on the board.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Stag** moves exactly as the [*Knight*](knight.html),
but with the path blown up by a factor of two. It gets trapped on
step 2,015.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Stag** bounces around for a couple of
moves before it falls into a pattern where it visits four out of
the last seven squares of each second row. It escapes to infinity
staying on the right hand side of the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Stag** moves in exactly the same was as
on the Folded Wedge -- which isn't very surprising as the **Stag**
only visits the even rows, and the even rows on the Flat Wedge are
the same as on the Folded Wedge.
