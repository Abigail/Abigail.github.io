# Missionary

The **Missionary** moves one or two unoccupied squares orthogonally
or diagonally. This makes the **Missionary**, meaning it cannot
reach half the squares on the board.

In [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Missionary**
promotes to the [*Otter*](otter.html).

### Spiral

On the Spiral the **Missionary** follows a pattern similar to the
[*Bishop*](bishop.html), except for the parts the [*Bishop*](bishop.html)
skips; the **Missionary** will visit every second square on such parts.
The **Missionary** will visit
\(\frac{1}{2} \cdot
((\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}) \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4}) =
  \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\frac{9}{16} + \frac{1}{4}) =
  \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{13}{16} = \frac{13}{32} = 40.625\%\)
of the squares.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Missionary** will escape using a stepwise pattern, 
visiting the right most square, and the square two to the left of the
rightmost square of every row.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Missionary** stays to the far right, escaping
along the edge of the Wedge.
