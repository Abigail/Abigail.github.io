# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either leaps to a square which is one away in one 
orthogonal direction and two the other (like a [*Knight*](knight.html)),
leaps to a square which is one away in one orthogonal direction,
and three in the other (like a [*Camel*](camel.html)), or to a square
which is two away in one orthogonal direction, and three in the
other (like a [*Zebra*](zebra.html)).

This makes the %%PIECE%% a %%COMPOUND_LEAPER%%.
