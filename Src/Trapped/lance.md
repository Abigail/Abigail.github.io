under different names.

### Spiral

On either Spriral the **Lance** escapes in a straight line to
infinity with an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

On both the Folded and the Flat Wedge, the **Lance** 
escapes to infinity using the same line as the Spiral, hence
its escape velocity is \(1\) as well.
