# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either leaps to a square which is two away in any of
the four orthogonal directions (like the [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html)),
or to a square which is two away in one orthogonal direction, and
one away in the other (like the [*Knight*](knight.html)).
This makes the %%PIECE%% a %%COMPOUND_LEAPER%%.
