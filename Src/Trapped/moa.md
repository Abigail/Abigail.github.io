# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% moves as the [*Knight*](knight.html), but it
may not jump. It moves one square diagonally (which must
be unoccupied), then one square orthogonally outward.

Compare this to the [*Mao*](mao.html) which reaches the same
squares, but first moves orthogonally, then diagonally.

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped quickly, after no more than 21 steps.

#### Diamond

The %%PIECE%% gets trapped quickly, after 35 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% uses the two step loop to move one square forward
and to the right, for an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{2}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% moves exactly as it does on the
Folded Wedge. So, it escapes with an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{2}\).
