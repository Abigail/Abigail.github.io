The **Dragon** either makes a single or double [*Alfi*](alfil.html)
step (that is it jumps to a square two away diagonally, and if this
square is unoccupied, it optionally jumps to a square another
two away in the same direction -- so, like a very limited
[*Alfilrider*](alfilrider.html)), or it jumps to a square three
away in one orthogonal direction, and one away in the other
(like a [*Camel*](camel.html)).
This makes the **Dragon** %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

The %%KNIGHT%%-%%PAWN%% compound is also called a [*Dragon*](dragon.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Dragon** circles around the origin in a clockwise manner, until
it gets trapped on step 14,582.

#### Diamond

It takes about ten times as long for the **Dragon** to get trapped on
the Diamond Spiral: after circling the origin in a clockwise manner,
it does get trapped on step 149,823.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Dragon** does not get trapped for its first billion steps.
But it's not clear whether it remains free forever.

#### Flat

It takes a long time for the **Dragon** to get trapped on the
Flat Wedge, but eventually it does, on step 734,298,797.
