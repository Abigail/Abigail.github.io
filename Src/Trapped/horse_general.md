The **Horse General** either moves to one square diagonally forward
(like a forward %%FERZ%%), moves on square orthogonally backward
(like a backward %%WAZIR%%), or it slides up to three unoccupied
squares orthogonally forward (like a limited forward %%ROOK%%).

### Spiral

#### Square

After making one clockwise rotation, the **Horse General** uses a
three step loop to move one square diagonally backward, giving
it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Horse General** moves in a straight
line forward, giving it an escape velocity of \(1\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Horse General** uses a six step loop
to move two square diagonally forward, giving it an escape
velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Horse General** escapes in a straight
diagonal path forward, visiting the right most square of each row.
This gives it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2%%.
