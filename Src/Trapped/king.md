# King

The **King** (&#x2654;) can step one square away in all eight directions.
[Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) has Kings as well,
the *King General* (&#x738b;&#x5c07;) and the
*Jeweled General* (&#x7389;&#x5c07;),
which moves in exactly the same way. (*King General* and *Jeweled General*
are names for the same piece, but of opposite sides).

A *Mann* is a piece which moves in exactly the same way, but a *Mann*
is not *royal*. (Royal pieces are pieces which need lead to a loss
of the game when they are captured). Royalness however, does not
matter in our investigation. A *Prince* is another name for a *Mann*.

In the Sh&#x14d;gi variant [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi),
the **King** is known as the *Lion*.

### Spiral

The **King** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html)
will follow the Spiral. Hence, the **King** will visit all the squares on
the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **King** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
and the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html)
will follow the Folded Wedge. Hence, the **King** will visit all the squares on
the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **King** fills the board row by row, alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge.
