# King

The **King** (&#x2654;) can step one square away in all eight directions.

The **King** is a *Royal Piece*, which means that if it's captured,
that side loses. Of course, for our investigation, Royalness plays
no part.

The **King** appears in many Chess variants, sometimes
by different names.

In [Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) the **King** is also
called the *King General* (&#x738b;&#x5c07;) (for one side) and the
*Jeweled General* (&#x7389;&#x5c07;) (for the other side).

In [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi),
the **King** is known as the *Phoenix* (&#x9d6c;).

In the Sh&#x14d;gi variant [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi),
the **King** is known as the *Lion*.

[*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) has the *Commoner*, which moves
exactly as the **King**, but which is not Royal. The *Commoner* promotes
to a [*Wildebeest*](gnu.html?piece=wildebeest).

Other names for this piece include:
include *Mann* (not Royal), and *Prince* (sometimes Royal). 

### Spiral

[*Wazir*](wazir.html)
will follow the Spiral. Hence, the **King** will visit all the squares on
the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **King** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
and the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html)
will follow the Folded Wedge. Hence, the **King** will visit all the squares on
the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **King** fills the board row by row, alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge.
