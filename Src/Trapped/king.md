# King

The **King** (&#x2654;) can step one square away in all eight directions.

The **King** is a *Royal Piece*, which means that if it's captured,
that side loses. Of course, for our investigation, Royalness plays
no part.

The **King** appears in many Chess variants, sometimes
by different names.

The **King** in [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) and
[Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) promotes to
the [*Emperor*](king.html?piece=emperor). In
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) under some conditions the
**King** may
also promote to the [*Emperor of Emperors*](emperor_of_emperors.html).

### Kings in Sh&#x14d;gi and Sh&#x14d;gi variants

In [Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) the **King** is also
called the *King General* (&#x738b;&#x5c07;) (for one side) and the
*Jeweled General* (&#x7389;&#x5c07;) (for the other side).

In [Tori Sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Tori_Shogi),
the **King** is known as the *Phoenix* (&#x9d6c;).

In the Sh&#x14d;gi variant [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi),
the **King** is known as the *Lion*.

### Other Royal King movers

The *Tiger Prince*, as found in [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised)
moves (but does not capture) as the **King**. (It captures as the
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html) or [*Knight*](knight.html), but we ignore
capture moves). The [*Blind Tiger*](blind_tiger.html) promotes to the
[*Tiger Prince*].

### Non Royal King movers

[Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) and
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) have the *Commoner*, which moves
exactly as the **King**, but which is not Royal. The *Commoner* promotes
to a [*Wildebeest*](gnu.html?piece=wildebeest).

Also in [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) is the
*Elephant Prince*. This moves, but not capture, as the **King**. It also
captures like the [*Knight*](knight.html) and [*Alfil*](alfil.html), but
we ignore captures. The *Elephant Prince* is the promoted 
[*Drunk Elephant*](drunk_elephant.html).

The *Cicada* from [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) moves
(but does not capture) as the **King**. The *Cicada* also has hopping
moves and captures in the directions of the [*Queen*](queen.html),
but we will ignore hopping moves as we're studying the movements of
a single piece on an infinite board -- so there will not be any other
piece to hop over. The *Cicada* promotes to the 
[*Typhoon*](genie.html?piece=typoon).

The *Overtaker* from [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised) moves
as the **King**. To capture, the *Overtaker* must hop, but we ignore
capturing moves. The *Overtaker* promotes to the
[*Nightrider*](knightrider.html).

The *Salamander*, also from [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised),
moves as the **King**. It can also move as the [*Queen*](queen.html)
(up to four squares), but only if it lands adjacent to a friendly piece.
We can ignore such moves. The *Salamander* promotes to the
[*Genie*](genie.html).

The *Undertaker*, as found in [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised),
moves like the **King**. To capture, it has to move away from an adjacent
enemy piece (but we ignore captures). The *Undertaker* promotes to
the [*Dayrider*](dayrider.html).

Other names for this piece include:
include *Mann* (not Royal), and *Prince* (sometimes Royal). 

### Spiral

The **King** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and the
[*Wazir*](wazir.html)
will follow the Spiral. Hence, the **King** will visit all the squares on
the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **King** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
and the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html)
will follow the Folded Wedge. Hence, the **King** will visit all the squares on
the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **King** fills the board row by row, alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge.
