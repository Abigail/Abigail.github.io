# King

The Chess King (&#x2654;) can step one square away in all eight directions.
[Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) has Kings as well,
the King General (&#x738b;&#x5c07;) and Jeweled General (&#x7389;&#x5c07;),
which moves in exactly the same way. (King General and Jeweled General
are names for the same piece, but of opposite sides).

A *Mann* is a piece which moves in exactly the same way, but a Mann
is not *royal*. (Royal pieces are pieces which need lead to a loss
of the game when they are captured). Royalness however, does not
matter in our investigation. A *Prince* is another name for a *Mann*.

#### Spiral

The King can move as the [Wazir](wazir.html), and the [Wazir](wazir.html)
will follow the Spiral. Hence, the King will visit all the squares on
the board.

#### Wedge

The King can move as the [Gold General](gold_general.html),
and the [Gold General](gold_general.html)
will follow the Wedge. Hence, the King will visit all the squares on
the board.
