# King &#x2654;

The King can step one square away in all eight directions. This means,
just like the [Wazir](wazir.html),
the King can always step to the unvisited square with the lowest value:
the King simply follows the spiral. Hence, it never gets trapped, and
eventually, will visit all squares.
