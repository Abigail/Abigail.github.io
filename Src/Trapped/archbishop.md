# Archbishop

The [**Archbishop**](#wiki:Princess_(chess)) combines the movements
of the [*Knight*](knight.html) and [*Bishop*](bishop.html).

It is a frequently seen fairy chess piece. Problemists call this
piece a *Princess*. In *Turkish Great Chess*, the piece was
known as a *Vizir*. In *Carrera's chess*, dating from the early
17th century, the piece was called *Centaur*. 

Then name **Archbishop** was introduced by

in [*Capablanca Chess*](#wiki).

Another common name for the piece is *Cardinal*.
[*Overkill Ecumenical Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess)
for instance uses this name, and so does [*Grand Chess*](#wiki).

In [*Janus Chess*](#wiki), the piece is called a *Janus*.

Other, less common names are: *Adjutant*, *Aircraft*, *Davidson*, *Deacon*,
*Equerry*, *Fox*, *Hawk*, *Horseman*, *Monk*, *Pilot*, *Police Chief*,
*Prime Minister*, *Rhino*, *Squire*, *Superbishop*, *Templar*,
*Wazir*, and *Zek*.


### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Archbishop** follows an irregular pattern
in a clockwise direction around the origin, getting trapped after
6386 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Archbishop** fills the board evenly.
There will only be a handful of rows which have been partially 
visited. A few different patterns are used when the 
**Archbishop** goes from one side of the wedge to the other.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Archbishop** also fills the entire board,
but it has a strong bias to the right hand side of the Wedge.
The distance between the highest completed row, and the lowest
unvisited row will always be increasing.
