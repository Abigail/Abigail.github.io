### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% follows an irregular pattern
in a clockwise direction around the origin, getting trapped after
6,386 steps.

#### Diamond

The %%PIECE%% takes a lot longer to get trapped on
the Diamond Spiral, but eventually, it gets trapped on step 318,714.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% fills the board evenly.
There will only be a handful of rows which have been partially 
visited. A few different patterns are used when the 
**Archbishop** goes from one side of the wedge to the other.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% also fills the entire board,
but it has a strong bias to the right hand side of the Wedge.
The distance between the highest completed row, and the lowest
unvisited row will always be increasing.
