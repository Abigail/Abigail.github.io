The **Plodding Ox** either moves one square diagonally
(like a %%FERZ%%), or slides an unlimited
amount of unoccupied squares orthogonally forward or backward
(like a vertical [*Rook*](rook.html)).

The movements of the **Plodding Ox** are the movements of
the [*Side Flyer*](side_flyer.html), but rotated by 90&deg;.

### Spiral

Using a complicated pattern, on the Square Spiral, the
**Plodding Ox** visits all the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

The **Plodding Ox** follows a clockwise square spiral, visiting
all the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Plodding Ox** uses a six step loop to
move two squares diagonally forward. This gives it an escape
velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_3%%.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Plodding Ox** visits the right most
square of each row, giving it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2%%.
