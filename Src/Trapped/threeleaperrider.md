# Threeleaperrider

At each move, the Threeleaperrider makes one or more steps as the
[Threeleaper](threeleaper.html) does, provided all the steps are
in the same direction, and all squares it steps over are unoccupied.

That is, it moves 3, 6, 9, 12, etc squares in an orthogonal direction,
as long as each 3<sup>rd</sup> square is unoccupied. (It may leap
over any other occupied squares).

The Threeleaperrider moves in a similar way as the [Rook](rook.html),
except the path is blown up by a factor of 3.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the Threeleaperrider spirals outward, visiting
\(\frac{1}{9} = 11.\overline{1} \%\) of the squares.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the Threeleaperrider gets trapped after 6 steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the Threeleaperrider escapes to infinity in a stepwise
pattern.
