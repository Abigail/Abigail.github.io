# Caliph

The **Caliph** is a piece from [*Overkill Ecumenical
Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess).

This pieces moves as either the [*Bishop*](bishop.html) or as
the [*Camel*](camel.html). That is, it can slide an unlimited
number of squares diagonally (as long as all the squares it passes
over are unoccupied), or it jumps to a square which is 3 squares
away in one orthogonal direction, and 1 square away in the
other direction. Since both the *Bishop* and *Camel* are 
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound), so is the
*Caliph*.

There is another piece called [*Caliph*](caliph.html), which
combines the moves of the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) and [*Alfil*](alfil.html).


### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Caliph** gets trapped after 1563 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Using a simple, but pretty, pattern, the **Caliph** fills 50% 
(due to it being colourbound) of the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

Using a very simple pattern, the **Caliph** fills 50% (due to it
being colourbound) of the Flat Wedge. While simple, the travel pattern
is interesting in the sense that the path the **Caliph** traces
does not intersect itself. For the Flat Wedge, that's pretty rare
for a piece which fills the Wedge.
