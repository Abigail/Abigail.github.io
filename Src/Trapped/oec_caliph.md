# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either slides a unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally (like the [*Bishop*](bishop.html)), or jumps
to a square which is three away in one orthogonal direction,
one away in the other (a [*Camel*](camel.html) jump).
This makes the %%PIECE%% %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

  {th = 1} %%OVERKILL%%
& {cs = 2} **Caliph**
&          The [*Wazir*](wazir.html)-[*Alfil*](alfil.html) compound
           is also called [*Caliph*](caliph.html) \\

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped after 1,563 steps.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the %%PIECE%% moves like the [*Ferz*](ferz.html),
never making a [*Camel*](camel.html) jump. Hence, it will visit
50% of the squares on the board, in a simple pattern.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Using a simple, but pretty, pattern, the %%PIECE%% fills 50% 
(due to it being colourbound) of the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

Using a very simple pattern, the %%PIECE%% fills 50% (due to it
being colourbound) of the Flat Wedge. While simple, the travel pattern
is interesting in the sense that the path the %%PIECE%% traces
does not intersect itself. For the Flat Wedge, that's pretty rare
for a piece which fills the Wedge.
