The **Caliph** either slides a unlimited number of unoccupied
squares diagonally (like the [*Bishop*](bishop.html)), or jumps
to a square which is three away in one orthogonal direction,
one away in the other (a [*Camel*](camel.html) jump).
This makes the **Caliph** %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Caliph** gets trapped after 1,563 steps.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Caliph** moves like the [*Ferz*](ferz.html),
never making a [*Camel*](camel.html) jump. Hence, it will visit
50% of the squares on the board, in a simple pattern.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Using a simple, but pretty, pattern, the **Caliph** fills 50% 
(due to it being colourbound) of the Folded Wedge.

#### Flat

Using a very simple pattern, the **Caliph** fills 50% (due to it
being colourbound) of the Flat Wedge. While simple, the travel pattern
is interesting in the sense that the path the **Caliph** traces
does not intersect itself. For the Flat Wedge, that's pretty rare
for a piece which fills the Wedge.
