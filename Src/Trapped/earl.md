# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either slides an unlimited number of squares in any
of the four orthogonal directions (like the %%ROOK%%), or it makes
a non-jumping %%KNIGHT%%'s move (like the [*Bowman*](bowman.html)),
that is, it either moves one square
orthogonally followed by one square diagonally outward, or one square
diagonally outward, where in either case, the first square must be
unoccupied.

### Spiral

#### Square

The %%PIECE%% can move as the %%WAZIR%%, and hence, it will just follow
the spiral.

#### Diamond

The pattern the %%PIECE%% follows on the Diamond Spiral is almost regular,
but not regular enough -- it gets trapped after 1,431 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% uses a simple pattern to visit every square on the Folded
Wedge.

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% uses a simple pattern to visit every square on the Flat
Wedge.
