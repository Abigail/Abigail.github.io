# Queen &#x2655;

The Queen can slide an unlimited number of squares in all eight 
directions: four orthogonal directions and four diagonal directions.
It cannot slide over occupied squares.

### Spiral

The Queen can move like a [Wazir](wazir.html), and a Wazir 
can follow the Spiral. Hence, the Queen will fill the entire board,
and not get trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The Queen can move like the [Gold General](gold_general.html), and
hence will follow the Wedge, filling the entire board.

#### Flat

The Queen will fill the entire board, but in doing so, it has a 
strong bias on the right hand side of the board.
