# Queen &#x2655;

The Queen can slide an unlimited number of squares in all eight 
directions: four orthogonal directions and four diagonal directions.
It cannot slide over occupied squares.

That means, it can move like a [Wazir](wazir.html), and a Wazir 
can follow the spiral. Hence, the Queen will fill the entire board,
and not get trapped.
