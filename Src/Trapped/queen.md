# Queen &#x2655;

The **Queen** can slide an unlimited number of squares in all eight 
directions: four orthogonal directions and four diagonal directions.
It cannot slide over occupied squares. The **Queen** combines the
movements of the [*Rook*](rook.html) and [*Bishop*](bishop.html).

### Spiral

The **Queen** can move like a [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and a *Wazir* 
can follow the Spiral. Hence, the **Queen** will fill the entire board,
and not get trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Queen** can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), and
hence will follow the Wedge, filling the entire board.

#### Flat

The **Queen** will fill the entire board, but in doing so, it has a 
strong bias on the right hand side of the board.
