# Queen &#x2655;

The **Queen** can slide an unlimited number of squares in all eight 
directions: four orthogonal directions and four diagonal directions.
It cannot slide over occupied squares. The **Queen** combines the
movements of the [*Rook*](rook.html) and [*Bishop*](bishop.html).

In [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco),
and [Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the **Queen** is the promoted
[*Stork*](alfil.html?piece=stork).

The *Vulture* in [Scirocco](#chess-v:rules/scirocco)
moves like the **Queen** (but it cannot capture on its diagonal
moves which are not direction adjacent to its starting square). The
*Vulture* is the promoted [*Scirocco*](dragon_horse.html?piece=scirocco).

The *Immobilizer* moves (but does not capture) as the **Queen**. It will
prevent any adjacent piece (from the other side) to move. In
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the *Immobilizer* is the
promoted [*Hummingbird*](hummingbird.html).

The *Longleaper* moves (but not captures) like the **Queen**. It has
additional hopping capture moves, but we ignore those. In
[Typhoon](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the [*Cuckoo*](cuckoo.html)
promotes to the *Longleaper*.

### Spiral

The **Queen** can move like a [*Wazir*](wazir.html), and a *Wazir* 
can follow the Spiral. Hence, the **Queen** will fill the entire board,
and not get trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Queen** can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html), and
hence will follow the Wedge, filling the entire board.

#### Flat

The **Queen** will fill the entire board, but in doing so, it has a 
strong bias on the right hand side of the board.
