### Spiral

#### Square

The **Bishop's Dog**'s movement falls between the movement
of the [*Ferz*](ferz.html), and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html), which
both do not get trapped. Surprisingly, the **Bishop's Dog** does
get trapped, and it gets trapped after 129 steps.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Bishop's Dog** moves as the [*Ferz*](ferz.html),
visiting \(50%\) of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Bishop's Dog** escapes to infinity
using the same pattern as the [*Ferz*](ferz.html). It
escapes to the upper right, using a three step loop, giving
it an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Bishop's Dog** escapes to infinity
by visiting only the right most square of each row. This
is an escape velocity of \(\sqrt{2}\).
