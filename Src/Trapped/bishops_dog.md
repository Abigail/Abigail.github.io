### Spiral

The %%PIECE%%'s movement falls between the movement
of the [*Ferz*](ferz.html), and the [*Bishop*](bishop.html), which
both do not get trapped. Suprisingly, the %%PIECE%%, does
get trapped, and it gets trapped after 129 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity
using a stepwise pattern on the right hand side of the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to infinity
by visiting only the right most square of each row.
