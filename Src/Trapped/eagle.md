# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied 
squares diagonally forward (like a forward %%BISHOP%%),
slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied unoccupied squares
orthogonally backwards (like a backward %%ROOK%%), steps
one square in each of eight main directions (like a %%KING%%),
or slides two squares diagonally backwards (where the square in between must
be unoccupied) (like a limited range backward %%BISHOP%%).

            The **Eagle** does not appear in the starting array of the game. \\

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the %%PIECE%% can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the
piece will do so, following the Spiral and visiting all the squares
in order.

#### Diamond

Since the %%PIECE%% can move like the %%BM%% the
piece will do so, following the Spiral and visiting all the squares
in order.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
the %%PIECE%% will follow the numbers.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% fills the board row by row, alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge. This is the same pattern the
[*Phoenix*](king.html?piece=phoenix) uses.
