# Eagle (&#x9d70;)

The **Eagle** either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied 
squares diagonally forward, slides an unlimited amount of 
unoccupied unoccupied squares orthogonally backwards, steps
one square in each of eight main directions, or slides two
squares diagonally backwards (where the square in between must
be unoccupied).

The **Eagle** is a piece from [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi).
It's not present on the board at the start of the game -- it appears
when a [*Falcon*](tori_falcon.html) promotes.

### Spiral

Since the **Eagle** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the
piece will do so, following the Spiral and visiting all the squares
in order.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Eagle** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
the **Goose** will follow the numbers.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Goose** fills the board row by row, alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge. This is the same pattern the
[*Phoenix*](king.html?piece=phoenix) uses.
