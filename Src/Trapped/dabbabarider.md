# Dabbabarider

The Dabbabarider moves like the [Dabbaba](dabbaba.html), but it
can move an unlimited amount of steps at each move. That is, at
each move, it can move 2, 4, 6, etc squares away from the
starting square in each of the four orthogonal directions, 
providing each second square is unoccupied.

Because of this, the Dabbabarider is *colour-bound*, always staying
on a square of the same colour.

### Spiral

The Dabbabarider moves exactly as the [Dabbaba](dabbaba.html) does, 
visiting 25% of all the squares.

### Wedge

Just like the Spiral, the Dabbabarider moves exactly as the
[Dabbaba](dabbaba.html) does, on both the Folded and Flat Wedge,
quickly escaping to infinity in a step wise pattern.
