### Spiral

#### Square

so it visits all the squares on the board, in order.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Divine Sparrow** visits all the
squares on the left side of the board, and squares on two more
columns and one row. As such, \(50\%\) of the squares are visited.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Divine Sparrow** visits all the squares
on the board.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Divine Sparrow** uses a two step loop to move
one square diagonally forward. It escapes with a velocity of %%SQRT_2%%.
