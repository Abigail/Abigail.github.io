The **FAD** combines the movements of the %%FERZ%%, the
[*Alfil*](alfil.html) and the [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html).
Thus, the **FAD** either jumps to a square one or two away diagonally
or two away orthogonally. Its movement cannot be blocked.
This makes the **FAD** %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

It turns out that on the Spirals and the Wedges, the **FAD** never 
makes use of its [*Alfil*](alfil.html) move option, so it moves
exactly in the same way as the [*Goat*](goat.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

The **FAD** follows the spiral, but it visits only every second square.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **FAD** moves like the %%FERZ%%, visiting
half the squares on the board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **FAD** follows the Folded Wedge, visiting every second square.

#### Flat

The **FAD** fills half the board, row by row, visiting every second
square. Before reaching the left side of the board, a small side step
is taken.
