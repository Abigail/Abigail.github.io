# Hunter

[Falcon-Hunter Chess](#wiki:Falcon-hunter_chess) is a chess variant
invented by Karl Schultz in 1943.

It introduces two new pieces, the Hunter, and the [Falcon](falcon.html).

The Hunter moves forward like the Chess [Rook](rook.html),
and backwards like a Chess [Bishop](bishop.html).

It gets trapped surprisingly fast, after 146 steps.
