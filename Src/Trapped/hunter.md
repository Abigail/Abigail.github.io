# Hunter

The **Hunter** either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
orthogonally forward (like the [*Rook*](rook.html)), or an unlimited
amount of unoccupied squares diagonally backward (like the
[*Bishop*](bishop.html)).

The **Hunter** is found in [Falcon-Hunter Chess](#wiki:Falcon-hunter_chess);
a chess variant invented by Karl Schultz in 1943.

In %%WHALE_SHOGI%%, the *Gray Whale* moves in the same way.

Compare this with the [*Falcon*](falcon.html), which mirrors the
movements of the **Hunter**.
