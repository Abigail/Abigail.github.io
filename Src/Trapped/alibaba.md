The **Alibaba** combines the movements of the [*Alfil*](alfil.html) and
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html). This makes it a %%COMPOUND_LEAPER%%, as it
combines the movements of two or more %%BASIC_LEAPERS%%.

The **Alibaba** jumps to a square two squares away from its starting
point, either orthogonally, or diagonally. It may jump over occupied squares. 
This makes the **Alibaba** not only %%COLOUR_BOUND%%, it also means the
**Alibaba** can only reach the squares which are both on an even row
and an even column. Only \(25\%\) of the squares are reachable.

If one would remove all the odd rows and odd files (none of them 
reachable by the **Alibaba**) the **Alibaba** moves like the 
[*King*](king.html).

There are several pieces which move this way:

& {cs = 2}  **Dervish**
&           %%PROMOTES_TO%% [*Harpy*](genie.html?piece=harpy); %%ABILITIES%% \\

& {cs = 2}  **Spider**
&           %%CAPTURE%% \\

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Spiral, the **Alibaba** follows the Spiral, but then with
its path blown up by a factor of two. Hence, it visits \(25\%\)
of the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond, the **Alibaba** follows same path the 
[*Blind Monkey*](blind_monkey.html) does, but then with
its path blown up by a factor of two. Hence, it visits \(25\%\)
of the squares on the board.

### Wedge

The **Alibaba** visits the same squares on both the Flat and Folded
Wedge, visiting the squares in the same order. It visits every other
square of ever other rows. Mostly going right to left, and left to
right, but with a small sidestep before reaching the left end of a row.
Hence, \(25\%\) of the squares on the board will be visited.
