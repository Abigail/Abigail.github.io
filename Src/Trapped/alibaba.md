# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the movements of the [*Alfil*](alfil.html) and
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html). This makes it a *combined leaper*, as it
combines the movements of two or more *basic leapers*.

The %%PIECE%% jumps to a square two squares away from its starting
point, either orthogonally, or diagonally. It may jump over occupied squares. 
This makes the %%PIECE%% %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

If one would remove all the odd rows and odd files (none of them 
reachable by the %%PIECE%%) the %%PIECE%% moves like the 
[*King*](king.html).

There are several pieces which move this way:

%%PIECE_HEADERS%%
  {th = 1}  *Combined Leapers*
& {cs = 2}  **Alibaba**
&           \\
  {th = 1}  %%SCIROCCO%%; %%TYPHOON%%
& {cs = 2}  **Dervish**
&           %%PROMOTES_TO%% [*Harpy*](genie.html?piece=harpy); %%ABILITIES%% \\

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% follows the Spiral, but then with
its path blown up by a factor of two.

### Wedge

The %%PIECE%% visits the same squares on both the Flat and Folded
Wedge, visiting the squares in the same order. It visits every other
square of ever other rows. Mostly going right to left, and left to
right, but with a small sidestep before reaching the left end of a row.
