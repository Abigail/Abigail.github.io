The **Gnu** moves either as the [*Knight*](knight.html) or
the [*Camel*](camel.html), making it both a *Knighted Piece*
and a %%COMPOUND_LEAPER%%. The **Gnu** jumps to a square which
is one away in one orthogonal direction, and two or three in the
other orthogonal direction.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Gnu** circles the origin clockwise, in an
irregular pattern. It doesn't get trapped in the first billion
steps, but it is not clear whether it will never get trapped.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Square, it takes a long time for the **Gnu** to
get trapped, but it does so on step 136,022,083.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the travelling pattern of the **Gnu** is less
irregular than the pattern on the Spiral, but it doesn't seem to
complete stabalize into something regular. The **Gnu** does not
get trapped for its first billion steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Gnu** will fill the entire board. It quickly
travels in a regular pattern, filling the board with a bias to the
right hand side.
