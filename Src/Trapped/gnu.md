### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% circles the origin clockwise, in an
irregular pattern. It doesn't get trapped in the first 1,067,426,464
steps, but it is not clear whether it will never get trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the travelling pattern of the %%PIECE%% is less
irregular than the pattern on the Spiral, but it doesn't seem to
complete stabalize into something regular. The %%PIECE%% does not
get trapped for its first 1,056,869,405 steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% will fill the entire board. It quickly
travels in a regular pattern, filling the board with a bias to the
right hand side.
