# Gnu

The **Gnu** moves either as the [*Knight*](knight.html) or
the [*Camel*](camel.html), making it a *Knighted Piece*.

It is used by Problemists, and also appears in
[*Overkill Ecumenical Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess).

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Gnu** circles the origin clockwise, in an
irregular pattern. It doesn't get trapped in the first 20,000
steps, but it is not clear whether it will enver get trapped.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the travelling pattern of the **Gnu** is less
irregular than the pattern on the Spiral, but it doesn't seem to
complete stabalize into something regular. The **Gnu** does not
get trapped for its first 20,000 steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Gnu** will fill the entire board. It quickly
travels in a regular pattern, filling the board with a bias to the
right hand side.
