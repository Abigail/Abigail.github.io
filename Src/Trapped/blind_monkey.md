The **Blind Monkey** can move either one square diagonally, or one step
sideways (to the right or left). That is, it makes the same moves
as a [*King*](king.html), except for stepping straight forward or backward.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Blind Monkey** visits all the squares, filling the
squares in roughly a flattened hexagon.

#### Diamond

The **Blind Monkey** is the canonical piece for following the the Diamond
Spiral. You need five different movements (stepping one square in
each of the four diagonal directions, and one step to the right).
The **Blind Monkey** can move to six different destinations -- one movement
possibility is not used (stepping one square to the left). However,
**Blind Monkey** is the "smallest" piece to follow the Diamond Spiral whose
movements are symmetric.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Blind Monkey** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it can follow the numbers and fill the complete board trivially.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Blind Monkey** fills the board row by row,
alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge. It visits the squares in the
same order the [*King*](king.html) does.
