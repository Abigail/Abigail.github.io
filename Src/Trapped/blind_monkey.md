# Blind Monkey (&#x76f2;&#x733f;)

The **Blind Monkey** can move either one square diagonally, or one step
sideways (to the right or left). That is, it makes the same moves
as a [*King*](king.html), except for stepping straight forward or backward.

The **Blink Monkey** is a piece which appears in
[*Dai dai sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Dai_dai_shogi)
(&#x5927;&#x5927;&#x5c06;&#x68cb;) and some
other large Sh&#x14d;gi variants.

The *Drunken Ferz*, the *Diabolo*, and the *Blind Bear*
(from [*Taikyoku sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Taikyoku_shogi)) move in the same way.


### Spiral

On the Spiral, the **Blind Monkey** visits all the squares, filling the
squares in roughly a flattened hexagon.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Blind Monkey** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it can follow the numbers and fill the complete board trivially.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Blind Monkey** fills the board row by row,
alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge. It visits the squares in the
same order the [*King*](king.html) does.
