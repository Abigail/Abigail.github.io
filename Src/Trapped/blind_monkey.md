# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% can move either one square diagonally, or one step
sideways (to the right or left). That is, it makes the same moves
as a [*King*](king.html), except for stepping straight forward or backward.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the %%PIECE%% visits all the squares, filling the
squares in roughly a flattened hexagon.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it can follow the numbers and fill the complete board trivially.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% fills the board row by row,
alternating going
with and against the numbers, with a small twist just before reaching
the left hand side of the Wedge. It visits the squares in the
same order the [*King*](king.html) does.
