The **Ky&#x014D;to** alternates moving as the
[*Tokin*](gold_general.html) (aka *Gold General*) and
the [*Lance*](lance.html) (a forward %%ROOK%%), starting with the former.
This means, on odd moves, the **Ky&#x014D;to** moves one square 
orthogonally, or one square diagonally forward, and on
even moves, the **Ky&#x014D;to** slides an unlimited number of
squares orthogonally forward.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Ky&#x014D;to** escapes to the upper right using
a step wise pattern. Its using a two step loop to move to a square
one away to the upper right. Which results in an escape velocity
of \(\frac{2}{2}\).

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Ky&#x014D;to** escapes upward, using a four
step loop to move two square upward. This means an escape velocity 
of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Ky&#x014D;to** escape upwards, byt visiting
all the squares (but one) of the file the origin is on, and
the file just left of it. It uses a block like pattern to do so.
This results in an escape velocity of \(\frac{1}{2}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Ky&#x014D;to** escapes to the upper right
by visiting the two right most squares of each row (except
the first two). This is an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
