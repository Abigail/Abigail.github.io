The **Great Tiger** either slides an unlimited number of squares in 
orthogonally sideways or backwards (like a sideways-backward %%ROOK%%),
or steps one square orthogonally forward (like a forward %%WAZIR%%).

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the **Great Tiger** movement is a superset of the movement of the
%%WAZIR%%, it follows the Spiral, visiting all squares
on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Great Tiger** uses a regular pattern to fill
\(75\%\) of the board. Half the squares of two of the quadrants are visited
and all of the squares on the other two quadrants.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Great Tiger** gets trapped after 6 steps,
in the same way the %%ROOK%% is.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge the **Great Tiger** quickly escapes to infinity by
alternating make a step forward, and a step to the right. This two
step loop to move on square diagonally forward gives it an escape
velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_2%%.
