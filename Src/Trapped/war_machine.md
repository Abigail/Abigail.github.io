### Spiral

#### Square

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
it will just follow the Spiral, filling the entire board.

#### Diamond

The %%PIECE%% will visit all the squares using an interesting
pattern.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The %%PIECE%% fills the Folded Wedge row by row, going left
to right on even rows, and right to left on odd rows.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% fills the board row by row
as well, but each row requires two passes: a left to right sweep visiting
the even squares, and a right to left sweep visiting the odd squares.
