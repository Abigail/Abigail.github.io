# War Machine

The **War Machine** moves like either the [*Wazir*](wazir.html)
or the [*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html). That is, it jumps either one or
two squares in an orthogonal direction. It may jump over an 
occupied square.

The *Zig* from [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) (the promoted
[*Firzan*](ferz.html?piece=firzan)) moves in exactly the same way,
although it may hop over an enemy piece diagnonally to capture it.
But here, we ignore captures.

Other names for the **War Machine** include: *Machine*, *Wazaba*, 
and *Woody Rook* ([*Chess with different armies*](#wiki)).

### Spiral

Since the **War Machine** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
it will just follow the Spiral, filling the entire board.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **War Machine** fills the Folded Wedge row by row, going left
to right on even rows, and right to left on odd rows.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **War Machine** fills the board row by row
as well, but each row requires two passes: a left to right sweep visiting
the even squares, and a right to left sweep visiting the odd squares.
