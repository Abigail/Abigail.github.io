The **Right Iron Chariot** either steps one square in any of the
four orthogonal directions (like a %%WAZIR%%),
or slides an unlimited number of unoccupied squares diagonally
backward to the left (like a left backward %%BISHOP%%).

This mirrors the movement of the [*Left Iron Chariot*](left_iron_chariot.html).

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Right Iron Chariot** moves like the
%%WAZIR%%, visiting all the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Right Iron Chariot** uses a simple two step loop
to move one square backward. This way, it escapes with an escape
velocity of %%HALF%%.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Right Iron Chariot** get trapped after 6 steps,
in the same way the %%WAZIR%% does.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Right Iron Chariot** visits the two right
most squares of each row: a two step loop to move one square diagonally
forward. This gives it an escape velocity of %%SQRT_2_OVER_2%%.
