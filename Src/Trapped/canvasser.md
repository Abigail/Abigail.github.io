# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
in an orthogonal direction (like the [*Rook*](rook.html)), 
or jumps to a square which is three away in one orthogonal direction,
and one away in the other (it jumps like the [*Camel*](camel.html)).

### Spiral

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Rook*](rook.html), it
can also move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), which means it can
follow the Spiral, filling the entire board in a boring pattern.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% visits all the squares on
the board, filling the Wedge going left to right, and right to back,
using a handful of repeating patterns.

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% visits all the square of the Flat Wedge, using
a repeating pattern, and filling the board with a bias to the right
hand side.
