# Canvasser

The **Canvasser** is a piece from [*Overkill Ecumenical
Chess*](#chess-v:rules/overkill-ecumenical-chess).

The **Canvasser** combines the movements of the
[*Rook*](rook.html), and the [*Camel*](camel.html).

### Spiral

Since the **Canvasser** can move as the [*Rook*](rook.html), it
can also move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), which means it can
follow the Spiral, filling the entire board in a boring pattern.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Canvasser** visits all the squares on
the board, filling the Wedge going left to right, and right to back,
using a handful of repeating patterns.

#### Flat

The **Canvasser** visits all the square of the Flat Wedge, using
a repeating pattern, and filling the board with a bias to the right
hand side.
