The **Duke** either moves as a [*Knight*](knight.html), or as
a [*Rook*](rook.html), but then only up to four squares. That
is, the %%PIECE%% either slides up to four unoccupied squares
in an orthogonal direction, or jumps to a square which is two
away in one orthogonal direction, and one away in the other.

The **Duke** moves like a limited range [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html).

This is about the **Duke** in %%SCIROCCO%% and %%TYPHOON%%. The
%%RENN_CHESS%%. There is also a [*Duke*](duke_renn.html) in %%RENN_CHESS%%.
The [*King-Knight compound*](centaur.html) is called *Duke* as well.

            [Cobra Chess](#chess-v:large.dir/cobra.html) is
            named *Duke* as well. \\

### Spiral

#### Square

The **Duke** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it fill the
board by following the Spiral.

#### Diamond

Since the [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html) never takes a long
%%ROOK%% move, the **Duke** follows the same path as the
[*Chancellor*](chancellor.html) does, and it gets trapped
after 1,563 steps.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Duke** fills the entire board by going
left to right, and right to left, bouncing between two successive rows.
This is the same pattern the [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html) follows.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Duke** also fills the entire board by going
left to right, and right to left, bouncing between two successive rows,
but in a slightly different pattern than on the Folded Wedge.
This is the same pattern the [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html) follows.
