# Duke

The **Duke** either moves as a [*Knight*](knight.html), or as
a [*Rook*](rook.html), but then only up to four squares. That
is, the **Duke** either slides up to four unoccupied squares
in an orthogonal direction, or jumps to a square which is two
away in one orthogonal direction, and one away in the other.

The **Duke** moves like a limited range [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html).

In [*Scirocco*](#chess-v:rules/scirocco) and 
[*Typhoon*](#chess-v:rules/typhoon-revised), the [*Priest*](priest.html)
promotes to the **Duke**.

### Spiral

The **Duke** can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), so it fill the
board by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Duke** fills the entire board by going
left to right, and right to left, bouncing between two successive rows.
This is the same pattern the [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html) follows.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Duke** also fills the entire board by going
left to right, and right to left, bouncing between two successive rows,
but in a slightly different pattern than on the Folded Wedge.
This is the same pattern the [*Chancellor*](chancellor.html) follows.
