# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% either moves one square to the right or left
(like a sideways [*Wazir*](wazir.html)) or slides an unlimited
amount of unoccupied squares orthogonally forward or backward
(like a vertical [*Rook*](rook.html)).

### Spiral

The %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Wazir*](wazir.html) so it visits
all the squares by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html), the %%PIECE%% gets trapped 
on the Folded Wedge after 6 steps.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% escapes to the upper right 
using a step wise pattern.
