# Ferz

The Ferz is one of the basic leapers. It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four diagonal directions. This makes the Ferz
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound); as such, 
the Ferz can only reach half the squares of the board.

The Ferz will not get trapped. It follows a regular path around
the origin, creating spiral in the opposite direction of the 
main Spiral, and rotated 45&deg;.
