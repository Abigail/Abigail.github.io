The **Ferz** is a [*(1,1)-leaper*](leapers.html#basic_leapers).
It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four diagonal directions. This makes the **Ferz** %%COLOUR_BOUND%%.

Many games have a piece which moves like the **Ferz**.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral the **Ferz** will not get trapped.
It follows a regular path around
the origin, creating spiral in the opposite direction of the 
Spiral, and rotated 45&deg;. It will visited all the odd
valued squares, so \(50\%\) of the squares on the board.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Square, the **Ferz** follows the same regular
path around the origin as the Square Spiral, except that it
rotates the other way around. Hence, the pieces visits
\(50\%\) of the squares on the board.


### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Ferz** quickly escapes to infinity, using
a zig-zag pattern on the right hand side of the Wedge. It takes
three steps to move one square diagonally upward, giving it an 
escape speed of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\).

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Ferz** sticks the the right hand side
edge of the board, escaping to infinity. The escape speed is
\(\sqrt{2}\).
