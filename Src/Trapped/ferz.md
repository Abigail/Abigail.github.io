# Ferz

The **Ferz** is one of the basic leapers. It's a very old piece, appearing
in very early chess variants. It may step one square in each of the
four diagonal directions. This makes the **Ferz**
[colourbound](#wiki:Glossary_of_chess#Colorbound); as such, 
the **Ferz** can only reach half the squares of the board.

In the Sh&#x14d;gi variant [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi),
the *Elephant* moves in the same way as the **Ferz**.

[*Xiangqi*](#wiki) has a piece named *Advisor* (&#x58eb; for Black,
&#x4ed5; for Red), which moves in the
same way, except it cannot leave the 3x3 box it started from; this piece
is also known as *Counsellor*, *Mandarin*, *Guard*, *Officer*, *Scholar*,
*Assistant*, *Warrior* and, *Minister*.

### Spiral

On the Spiral the **Ferz** will not get trapped.
It follows a regular path around
the origin, creating spiral in the opposite direction of the 
Spiral, and rotated 45&deg;. It will visited all the odd
valued squares.


### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Ferz** quickly escapes to infinity, using
a zig-zag pattern on the right hand side of the Wedge.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Ferz** sticks the the right hand side
edge of the board, escaping to infinity.
