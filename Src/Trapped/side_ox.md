The **Side Ox** either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied
squares to the right of left (like a sideways %%ROOK%%),
or steps one square diagonally forward to the left, or diagonally
backward to the right (like a limited %%FERZ%%).

Compare with the [*Side Wolf*](side_wolf.html) whose movements
are mirrored, and the [*Wood Chariot*](wood_chariot.html) which
moves in the same way, but rotated by 90&deg;.
