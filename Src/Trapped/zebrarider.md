# Zebrarider

On each move, the Zebrarider makes one or more steps as a 
[Zebra](zebra.html), provided it doesn't turn, and each
step lands on an unoccupied square. The [Zebra](zebra.html)
is a (3,2)-leaper, that is, each move it moves to a square
three away in one orthogonal direction, and two away in the
other orthogonal direction.

### Spiral

On the Spiral, the Zebrarider gets trapped after 266 moves, which
is a lot quicker than the [Zebra](zebra.html), which doesn't get
trapped until step 4633.

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the Zebrarider gets trapped after 72 steps;
compare the [Zebra](zebra.html), which gets trapped on move 80.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the Zebrarider gets trapped after 57 steps.
This is a lot sooner than the [Zebra](zebra.html), which doesn't
get trapped until move 286.
