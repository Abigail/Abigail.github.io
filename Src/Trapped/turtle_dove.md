The **Turtle Dove** either slides up to five unoccupied squares
diagonally forward (like a limited forward %%BISHOP%%), or steps
one square orthogonally right, left or backward
(like a backward-horizontal %%WAZIR%%).

Compare with the [*Buddist Devil*](buddist_devil.html), which moves
in a similar way, except it may only slide up to three squares
diagonally forward.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Turtle Dove** gets trapped fairly
quickly. It gets trapped after 337 steps. It visits exactly the
same squares (and in the same order) as the
[*Buddist Devil*](buddist_devil.html).

#### Diamond

The **Turtle Dove** escapes using a two step loop to move one
square forward, giving it an escape velocity of %%HALF%%.

### Wedge

#### Folded

The **Turtle Dove** can move like the %%FC%%, and hence, visits
all the squares in order.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the **Turtle Dove** visits all the squares
on the board.
