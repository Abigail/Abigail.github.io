# Gold General

The **Gold General** (&#x91d1;&#x5c07;) from
[Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) either moves one step
in an orthogonal direction (like a [*Wazir*](wazir.html)), or one
step diagonally forward.

Sh&#x14d;gi has a few promoted pieces which move like a
**Gold General**: the *Promoted Silver General* (&#x6210;&#x9280;),
the *Promoted Katsura Horse* (&#x6210;&#x6842;) the *Promoted
Incense Chariot* (&#x6210;&#x9999;) (aka *Promoted Lance*),
and the *Reaches Gold* (&#x3068;&#x91d1;) (aka *Promoted Foot Soldier*
aka *Promoted Pawn*).

### Spiral

Since the **Gold General** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Gold General** can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Wedge.

#### Flat

The **Gold General** fills the Flat Wedge going from right to left, and
left to right, making a small sidestep just before reaching the left
edge. Compare this to the [*King*](king.html) and
[*Dragon Horse*](dragon_horse.html), which do something similar, with
with a slightly different sidestep.
