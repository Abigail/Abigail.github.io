# Gold General

The Gold General (&#x91d1;&#x5c07;) from
[Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) either moves one step
in an orthogonal direction (like a [Wazir](wazir.html)), or one
step diagonally forward.

Shogi has a few promoted pieces which move like a
Gold General: the Promoted Silver General (&#x6210;&#x9280;),
the Promoted Katsura Horse (&#x6210;&#x6842;) the Promoted
Incense Chariot (&#x6210;&#x9999;) (aka Promoted Lance),
and the Reaches Gold (&#x3068;&#x91d1;) (aka Promoted Foot Soldier
aka Promoted Pawn).

Since the Gold General can move like a Wazir, it does so, filling
the board by following the spiral.
