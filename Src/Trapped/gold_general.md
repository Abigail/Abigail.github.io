The **Gold General** either moves one step
in an orthogonal direction (like a [*Wazir*](wazir.html)), or one
step diagonally forward, like a forward [*Ferz*](ferz.html).

The **Gold General** is a common piece in many Sh&#x14d;gi variants.
Either as a piece on the starting array, but many pieces promote
to a piece moving like the **Gold General**.

### Spiral

#### Square

Since the **Gold General** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Spiral.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Gold General** escapes using a two step loop,
moving one square upward per loop iteration. This gives it an escape
speed of \(\frac{1}{2}\). Only two files will be visited, and no
squares below the origin will.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Gold General** can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Wedge.

#### Flat

The **Gold General** fills the Flat Wedge going from right to left, and
left to right, making a small sidestep just before reaching the left
edge. Compare this to the [*King*](king.html) and
[*Dragon Horse*](dragon_horse.html), which do something similar, with
with a slightly different sidestep.
