# Gold General

The **Gold General** (&#x91d1;&#x5c07;) either moves one step
in an orthogonal direction (like a [*Wazir*](wazir.html)), or one
step diagonally forward.

The **Gold General** is a piece in
[Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi). It appears in the
starting array, but several pieces also promote to the
**Gold General**: the [*Silver General*](silver_general.html)
(&#x6210;&#x9280;), the [*Lance*](lance.html) (&#x6210;&#x9999;),
the [*Knight*](shogi_knight.html) (&#x6210;&#x6842;)
and the [*Pawn*](pawn.html) (&#x3068;&#x91d1;). The
promoted *Pawn* is often called a *Tokin*.

In [D&#x14d;butsu sh&#x14d;gi](#wiki:Dobutsu_shogi), the 
[*Chick*](pawn.html?piece=dobutsu_chick) promotes to the *Hen*,
which moves a the **Gold General**.

### Spiral

Since the **Gold General** can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Gold General** can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Wedge.

#### Flat

The **Gold General** fills the Flat Wedge going from right to left, and
left to right, making a small sidestep just before reaching the left
edge. Compare this to the [*King*](king.html) and
[*Dragon Horse*](dragon_horse.html), which do something similar, with
with a slightly different sidestep.
