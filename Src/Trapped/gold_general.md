### Spiral

Since the %%PIECE%% can move like the [*Wazir*](wazir.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the %%PIECE%% can move like the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it does so, filling the board by following the Wedge.

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% fills the Flat Wedge going from right to left, and
left to right, making a small sidestep just before reaching the left
edge. Compare this to the [*King*](king.html) and
[*Dragon Horse*](dragon_horse.html), which do something similar, with
with a slightly different sidestep.
