# Left Quail (&#x9d89;)

The **Left Quail** either slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares 
orthogonally forward, or slides an unlimited amount of unoccupied squares
diagonally right-backward, or steps one square left-backward.

THe **Left Quail** is a piece from [*Tori Sh&#x14d;gi*](#wiki:Tori_Shogi).
Its mirror image (mirrored around a vertical line) is the
[*Right Quail*](right_quail.html).

### Spiral

Initially, on the Spiral, the **Left Quail** gives the impression its
movement pattern is regular, but then it gets trapped after only 146 steps!

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the **Left Quail** will only visit the three
left most squares of each row (except the bottom two), escaping
to infinity by sticking to the left side of the board. This is
exactly the same pattern the [*Right Quail*](right_quail.html) leaves
behind.

#### Flat

The movement of the **Left Quail** on the Flat Wedge is a mirror
image of the movement on the Folded Wedge: the three right most
squares of each row are visited while the **Left Quail** escapes
to infinity. This is exactly the same pattern the
[*Right Quail*](right_quail.html) leaves behind.
