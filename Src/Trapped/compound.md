# Compound Pieces

Compound pieces combine the movement of two traditional Chess pieces.
The Queen in [Chess](chess.html) is a example of a compound piece,
combining the Bishop and Rook.

We can classify the compound pieces into two classes: the Knighted
pieces which combine a piece with a Knight, and the Crowned pieces,
which combine a piece with a King.

## Knighted Pieces

### Archbishop

### Chancellor

### Amazon

<div class            = "trapped"
     data-name        = "knighted"
     data-piece-names = "archbishop,chancellor,amazon"> 
</div>  

## Crowned Pieces

### Dragon King

### Dragon Horse

<div class            = "trapped"
     data-name        = "crowned"
     data-piece-names = "dragon_king,dragon_horse"
</div>
