# Compound Pieces

Compound pieces combine the movement of two traditional Chess pieces.
The [Queen](chess.html#queen) in [Chess](chess.html) is a
example of a compound piece,
combining the [Bishop](chess.html#bishop) and [Rook](chess.html#rook).

We can classify the compound pieces into two classes: the Knighted
pieces which combine a piece with a [Knight][knight], and the Crowned pieces,
which combine a piece with a [King][king].

## Knighted Pieces

### Archbishop

### Chancellor

### Amazon

<div class            = "trapped"
     data-name        = "knighted"
     data-piece-names = "archbishop,chancellor,amazon"> 
</div>  

## Crowned Pieces

### Dragon King

### Dragon Horse

<div class            = "trapped"
     data-name        = "crowned"
     data-piece-names = "dragon_king,dragon_horse"
</div>
