The **Wide Knight** leaps to a square which is two squares away horizontally,
and one away vertically. This is equivalent to
half the moves of the %%KNIGHT%%.

Compare with the [*Narrow Knight*](heavenly_horse.html) which uses the other
half of the %%KNIGHT%% moves.

### Spiral

#### Square

On the Square Spiral, the **Wide Knight** visits \(25\%\) of the squares,
in a diamond shaped pattern. The path it traces never intersects itself.
This is the same path the [*Narrow Knight*](heavenly_horse.html) follows,
but then rotated by 90&deg;.

#### Diamond

On the Diamond Spiral, the **Wide Knight** traces the same path as on the
Square Spiral. \(25\%\) of the squares will be visited.

### Wedge

On neither the Folded and Flat Wedge, the **Wide Knight** can move.
