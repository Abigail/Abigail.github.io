# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% changes the way it move on each step. Its first step,
it moves like a [*Queen*](queen.html), then like a [*Knight*](knight.html),
then like a [*Bishop*](bishop.html), and
finally like a [*Rook*](rook.html), before starting the cycle again.

Compare to the [*Chameleon*](chameleon_dickins.html) as described by
Anthony Dickins, which cycles through the same pieces, in the same 
order, except that one starts moving as a %%KNIGHT%%.

### Spiral

#### Square

is 353 steps more than the [*Chameleon*](chameleon_dickins.html) which
starts moving as a %%KNIGHT%%.

#### Diamond

### Wedge

#### Folded

On the Folded Wedge, the %%PIECE%% gets trapped after 73 steps, 57 steps
more than the [*Chameleon*](chameleon_dickins.html) which starts moving
as a %%KNIGHT%%.

#### Flat

On the Flat Wedge, the %%PIECE%% uses an 8 step loop to move to
a square which lies two to the upper right from where it started
the loop, giving an escape velocity of \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\).
While escaping to the upper right, if visits the four
right most squares of each row.

The %%PIECE%% visits the same squares as the
[*Chameleon*](chameleon_dickins.html) which starts moving as a %%KNIGHT%%,
which has the same escape velocity, but it uses a different pattern.
