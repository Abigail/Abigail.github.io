# Dragon King

The Dragon King (&#x9f8d;&#x738b;) from
[Shogi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) combines the moves of
the [King](king.html) and the [Rook](rook.html). If the 
[Flying Chariot](rook.html?piece=flying_chariot) in Shogi promotes,
it becomes the Dragon King.

It's a so-called *crowned piece*, which is a *compound piece*, 
combining the movements of the King with one or more other pieces.

Since it can move as a King, it will not get stuck, filling the
entire boards by just following the spiral.
