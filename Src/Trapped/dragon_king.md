# Dragon King

The **Dragon King** (&#x9f8d;&#x738b;) from
[Sh&#x14d;gi (&#x5c06;&#x68cb;)](#wiki:Shogi) combines the moves of
the [King](king.html) and the [Rook](rook.html). If the 
[Flying Chariot](rook.html?piece=flying_chariot) in Sh&#x14d;gi promotes,
it becomes the Dragon King.

It's a so-called *crowned piece*, which is a *compound piece*, 
combining the movements of the *King* with one or more other pieces.

### Spiral

The **Dragon King** can move as a [*Wazir*](wazir.html). Hence, it will not
get stuck, filling the entire board by just following the spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the **Dragon King** can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it will do so, filling the entire board visiting all squares in value order.

#### Flat

The **Dragon King** visits all the squares on the Flat Wedge, with a
preference to the right hand side of the board.
