# %%PIECE%%

The %%PIECE%% combines the movements of
the [*King*](king.html) and [*Rook*](rook.html). That is, it steps
either one square diagonally, or slides an unlimited number of 
unoccupied squares orthogonally.

It's a so-called *crowned piece*, which is a *compound piece*, 
combining the movements of the *King* with one or more other pieces.

Pieces which can move like the %%PIECE%% can be found in
several games:

### Spiral

The %%PIECE%% can move as a [*Wazir*](wazir.html). Hence, it will not
get stuck, filling the entire board by just following the spiral.

### Wedge

#### Folded

Since the %%PIECE%% can move as the [*Flying Cock*](flying_cock.html),
it will do so, filling the entire board visiting all squares in value order.

#### Flat

The %%PIECE%% visits all the squares on the Flat Wedge, with a
preference to the right hand side of the board.
