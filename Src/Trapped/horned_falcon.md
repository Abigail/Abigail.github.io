The **Horned Falcon** either moves an unlimited number of unoccupied squares
in each orthogonal and diagonal direction, except straight forward
(so, like a [*Bishop*](bishop.html) or a sidewards/backwards
[*Rook*](rook.html)), or leaps one or two squares forward
(like a forward [*Wazir*](wazir.html) or a forward
[*Dabbaba*](dabbaba.html)).
