# Perl Weekly Challenge 141: Number Divisors

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
Write a script to find `lowest 10 positive integers` having exactly `8 divisors`.
<<<<

### Example

~~~~
24 is the first such number having exactly 8 divisors.
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.
~~~~

## Discussion

!observation
A positive integer has an odd number of divisors if and only
the number is a square.
!/observation

!observation
If \(d\) is a divisor of \(n\), then \(\frac{n}{d}\) is also
a divisor of \(n\).
!/observation

!observation
For every divisor \(d\) of a number \(n\), where \(n\) is not a square,
exactly one of \(d\) and \(\frac{n}{d}\) is less than \(\sqrt{n}\).
!/observation

This means that any number which is a square cannot have exactly
eight divisors. And for non-squares \(n\), the number has exactly eight
divisors, if, and only if, \(n\) has exactly four divisors less 
than \(\sqrt{n}\).

## Solutions

### Perl

The module [`Math::Prime::Util`](#) has a method `divisors` which,
in scalar context, returns the number if divisors a number has.

Which means that, after using the module, we're left with a one-liner:

~~~~
use Math::Prime::Util qw [divisors];

8 == divisors (++ $::n) && say ($::n) && $::c ++ while $::c < 10;
~~~~

Don't turn on warnings, as `$::c` starts off as undefined.

### Ruby

For all our other implementations, we start inspecting numbers `n`
starting from `1`. We can skip squares immediately. If the number
isn't a square, we count divisors, by checking all numbers `d` from `1`
to the square root of `n`. If `d` is a divisor of `n`, we increment
the divisor count by `2`.

We can break the loop if we have seen more than `8` divisors.

If a number `n` has `8` divisors, we print `n`. Once we have printed
`10` such numbers, we're done.

~~~~
count          = 10
nr_of_divisors =  8

n = 0
while count > 0 do
    n = n + 1
    s = Math . sqrt(n) . floor()
    if n == s * s then
       next
    end
    c = 0
    for d in 1 .. s do
        if n % d == 0 then
            c = c + 2
            if c > nr_of_divisors then
                break
            end
        end
    end
    if c == nr_of_divisors then
        puts (n)
        count = count - 1
    end
end
