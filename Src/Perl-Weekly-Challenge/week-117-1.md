# Perl Weekly Challenge 117: Missing Row

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-117/#TASK1)

> You are given text file with rows numbered `1-15` in random order but
> there is a catch one row in missing in the file.

>     11, Line Eleven
>     1, Line one
>     9, Line Nine
>     13, Line Thirteen
>     2, Line two
>     6, Line Six
>     8, Line Eight
>     10, Line Ten
>     7, Line Seven
>     4, Line Four
>     14, Line Fourteen
>     3, Line three
>     15, Line Fifteen
>     5, Line Five

> Write a script to find the missing row number.

## Solution

This is fairly trivial. The sum of the number \(1\) to \(15\) equals
\(\sum_{i=1}^{15} i = 120\). So, if we add the sum of the line numbers
in the file, and subtract this from \(120\) we get the missing row number.

### Perl

First we import the `sum` method from [`List::Util`](#):
~~~~
use List::Util qw [sum];
~~~~
Then we can get the answer in a one liner:
~~~~
say 120 - sum <>;
~~~~
We take advantage of the fact that if we use a string as a number,
Perl will look at the beginning of the string, and tries to interpret
that a number. It does issue a warning if there is some trailing stuff,
but hey, if you don't turn on warnings, you won't see them.

We could also have used a one-liner, not requiring another module, nor
having the number of lines hard coded:

~~~~
perl -nE '$;+=$.-$_;END{say$.+1+$;}'
~~~~

### AWK

Just like in Perl, AWK looks at the beginning of a string if it's
treated as a number. It won't issue a warning. So we get:
~~~~
BEGIN {SUM_15 = 120}
      {sum += $1}
END   {print SUM_15 - sum}
~~~~

### Bash
For the Bash solution, we split the input. Bash does this already be
default, splitting on white space. But we want to split on commas:
~~~~
IFS=","
~~~~
Now it's a matter of summing the first column, and subtracting the
result from 120:
~~~~
SUM_15=120
while read number tail; do ((sum += number)); done
echo $((SUM_15 - sum))
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### C
In C, we use the [`atol`](#) function to get the number at
the beginning of a string. 
~~~~
# define SUM_15 120

int main (void) {
    char *  line    = NULL;
    size_t  len     = 0;
    size_t  str_len;
    int     sum     = 0;

    while ((str_len = getline (&line, &len, stdin)) != -1) {
        sum += atol (line);
    }
    printf ("%d\n", SUM_15 - sum);
    free (line);

    return (0);
}
~~~~

### Go

In Go, we use the method `ReadString` in an `bufio` object to read
lines of input. On `EOF`, this method returns an error, which we
use to break the loop. Go does have an `Atoi` method, but that doesn't
work like `atoi` in C: it balks if there are non-numbers following the
number at the beginning of the string. So, we're going to use `Sscanf`
to parse the number.

~~~~
func main () {
    var i      int
    var sum    int = 0
    var SUM_15 int = 120

    var reader = bufio . NewReader (os. Stdin)
    for {
        var text, err1 = reader . ReadString ('\n')
        if (err1 != nil) {
            break
        }
        var n, err2 = fmt . Sscanf (text, "%d", &i)
        if (n < 1 || err2 != nil) {
            continue
        }
        sum += i
    }
    fmt . Printf ("%d\n", SUM_15 - sum)
}
~~~~

### Java

In Java, we use a `scanner` object to read lines of input. Using Google,
I found a couple of methods to convert string to integers, but all of them
require the string to contain exactly an integer. No `atoi` equivalent.

So, we're just parsing the beginning of the string manually. We're making
use of the `charAt` method on string objects: given an argument `n`,
it returns the ASCII value of the `n`th character in the string.

~~~~
import java.util.*;
    
public class ch1 {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner (System . in);
        int sum    = 0;
        int SUM_15 = 120;
        try {
            while (true) {
                String line = scanner . nextLine ();
                int i, n = 0;
                for (i = 0; i < line . length (); i ++) {
                    if (line . charAt (i) < "0" . charAt (0) ||
                        line . charAt (i) > "9" . charAt (0)) {
                        break;
                    }
                    n *= 10;
                    n += line . charAt (i) - "0" . charAt (0);
                }   
                sum += n;
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            System . out . println (SUM_15 - sum);
        }
    } 
}

### Lua

To turn the beginning of a string into a number, we capture the
leading digits, and use the function `tonumber` to make it a number:
~~~~
local SUM_15 = 120
local sum = 0
for line in io . lines () do
    sum = sum + tonumber (line : match ("%d+"))
end
print (SUM_15 - sum)

### Node.js

Here, we split the lines of input on a comma, and use the unary `+`
to change a string into a number:
~~~~
let SUM_15 = 120
let sum = 0

  require ('readline')
. createInterface ({input: process . stdin})   
. on              ('line', line => {
    let [num] = line . split (/,/)
    sum +=+ num
})
. on              ('close', () => console . log (SUM_15 - sum))
~~~~

### Python

Splitting on commas is the way to go in Python as well, and we
use `int` to turn the string into an integer:
~~~~
import fileinput

sum = 0
SUM_15 = 120

for line in fileinput . input ():
    sum = sum + int ((line . split (",")) [0])

print (SUM_15 - sum)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Ruby

Another `split` in Ruby, using the `to_i` method to turn the
result into an integer:
~~~~
sum = 0
SUM_15 = 120
ARGF . each_line do
    |line|
    sum += ((line . split (/,/)) [0]) . to_i
end

puts (SUM_15 - sum)
