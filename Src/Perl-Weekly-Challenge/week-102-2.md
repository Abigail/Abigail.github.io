# Perl Weekly Challenge 102: Hash-counting String

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-102/#TASK2)

> You are given a positive integer `$N`.
> 
> Write a script to produce Hash-counting string of that length.
> 
> The definition of a hash-counting string is as follows:
>
> * the string consists only of digits 0-9 and hashes, `#`
> * there are no two consecutive hashes: `##` does not appear in your string
> * the last character is a hash
> * the number immediately preceding each hash (if it exists) is the position
>   of that hash in the string, with the position being counted up from 1
> 
> It can be shown that for every positive integer `N` there is exactly
> one such length-`N` string.

### Examples

>     (a) "#" is the counting string of length 1
>     (b) "2#" is the counting string of length 2
>     (c) "#3#" is the string of length 3
>     (d) "#3#5#7#10#" is the string of length 10
>     (e) "2#4#6#8#11#14#" is the string of length 14

## Solution
We can solve this problem easily be working backwards, repeatedly
putting a `#` and a number, until we have filled the entire string
(the resulting string may start with a `#`, or a number).

We will use an array to keep track of what we have calculated what
goes in the string; if we're done, we print the content of the array
in reverse.

We will assume standard input contains the lengths (one length per
line of input) of the strings we need to print.

### Perl
~~~~
while (my $index = <>) {
    chomp $index;
    my @out;
    my $hash = 0;
    while ($index) {
        if ($hash = !$hash) {
            push @out => "#";
            $index --;
        }
        else {
            push @out =>      $index + 1;
            $index -= length ($index + 1);
        }
    }
    say join "" => reverse @out;
}
~~~~
`@out` contains the pieces we have to construct the resulting string
with. We're using `$hash` as a boolean indicating whether we going
to add a hash or a number, flipping its truth value on each iteration,
and starting with a hash. `$index` contains the position of where
the last character of *next* component will appear in the string
(1-based). The loop terminates if `$index` is 0.

If we're adding a hash, we subtract `1` from `$index`. If we are
adding a number, the number will be one larger than `$index`, as
that is the position where the next hash will be. We then subtract
the length of `$index + 1` from `$index`, as this is the number of
characters the number is going to be using.

Once we have the complete array, we reverse it, and print it.

### AWK

The AWK solution is similar to the Perl solution. We use a variable
`i` to keep track of our position in the array `out`, as AWK does
not have a `push` operation. A loop is used to print the resulting
array, as we lack a `join` operator. The role of `$index` is played
by the variable `idx`, as `index` is a reserved word in AWK.

~~~~
{
    idx  = $1
    hash = 0
    i    = 0
    while (idx) {
        i ++
        if (hash = !hash) {
            out [i] = "#"
            idx --
        }
        else {   
            out [i] =       idx + 1
            idx  -= length (idx + 1)
        }
    }
    for (; i; i --) {
        printf "%s", out [i]
    }
    printf "\n"
}
~~~~

### Bash
The Bash solution is similar to the AWK solution. No `push`, nor a `join`:

~~~~
while read index
do    declare -a out
      hash=0
      i=0
      while ((index > 0))
      do    ((i ++))
            if   ((hash = !hash))
            then out[$i]="#"
                 ((index --))
            else number=$((index + 1))
                 out[$i]=$number   
                 ((index -= ${#number}))
            fi
      done
      for ((; i; i --))
      do  printf "%s" ${out[$i]}
      done
      echo
done
~~~~

### Befunge-93
Despite looking very different, our Befunge-93 solution uses a
similar algorithm. We don't have variable in Befunge-93, but we do
have a stack. We use this stack to store the *characters* if the
resulting string, so we have to split any numbers into individual
characters. The reason for this is that if a number is printed,
Befunge-93 will also output a space -- which we do not want.

To keep track of the index, we write keep track of its value in a
cell of the program: cell `(1, 1)`. This means the program only
works for lengths up to 127, as cells will store signed `char`s
(which range from `-128` to `127`).

~~~~
>&:1+!#@_11p  >"#" 11g :1-!#v_ 11g1-11p > :55+% 86*+\ 11g1-11p 55+/ :#v_ v
                            $           ^                             <  $
              ^            _v# g11                                       <
^                           >:#v_$ 55+,
                            ^ ,<
~~~~

We can break down this program into several parts. First, we read
a number from standard input; if the number is `-1`, we have reached
the end of the input and we terminate the program. Else, we store
this number in the position `(1, 1)`. This number will play the
role of the `index` variable in our other solutions:

~~~~
>&:1+!#@_11p
~~~~

We now add an hash to the stack. If the index is `1`, this is the
last character to be placed, and we go to the printing code (see
later). We have made a copy, so the current index remains on the
stack; this is popped if we go to the printing routine.

~~~~
"#" 11g :1-!#v_
             $
~~~~

If we don't go printing the string yet, we first subtract `1` from
the index. We do this by fetching the value (which puts it on the
stack), subtract `1`, and then storing the result back (which removes
it from the stack):

~~~~
11g1-11p
~~~~

Else, we use a loop to split the index (the value before subtracting
is still on top of the stack) into individual characters: we mod
the number with `10` (`55+`), add `48` (`86*`) to get the ASCII
value, swap the two number on the stack (so the index is on the
top, and the character to be printed just below it); we subtract
`1` from the stored index (`11g1-11p`, as above), and divide the
top of the stack (the number we're converting to characters) by
`10` (`55+/`). We keep doing that until we have consumed this number:

~~~~
> :55+% 86*+\ 11g1-11p 55+/ :#v_
^                             <
~~~~

Once we've converted the entire number to characters, we check
whether the index has reached `0`. If so, we go to the printing
routine. Else, we go back to the part where the add a hash, and
continue from there:

~~~~
                                                           v
                                                           $
^            _v# g11                                       <
~~~~

Note that we enter this code fragment at the `v` on the top right.
If we go to the printing routine, this is at the `v` on the bottom
row.

Printing is just a matter of printing the stack, until the stack
is empty (that is, there is a `0` at the top of the stack):

~~~~
^                           >:#v_$ 55+,
                            ^ ,<
~~~~

Code is entered at the `ï¹¥` on the top row. If it's non-zero, e
print it, and loop back. Else, we pop the resulting `0`, and print
a newline (ASCII `10`): `55+,`. We're then running off the field
to the right, but since we're on a torus, we enter from the left
again, and we're being send up again (`^`), back to the beginning
of the program.

### C
C follows the more or less the same algorithm as AWK and Bash.
Except that we only put numbers into the `out` array; in C it is
much easier to have arrays all of the same type, and numbers are
easier to deal with than strings. If we want to put a hash into the
array, we put a `-1` there, and when we're printing out the array,
on encountering a `-1`, we print a hash:

~~~~
# define MAX_LENGTH 23

int main (void) {
    long long index;
    char tmp [MAX_LENGTH];

    while (scanf ("%lld", &index) > 0) {
        /*
         * Create an array of long longs. (More than we need).
         */
        long long * out;
        if ((out = (long long *) malloc (index * sizeof (long long))) == NULL) {
            perror ("Malloc 'out' failed");
            exit (1);
        }

        bool hash = false;
        size_t i = 0;

        while (index) {
            if ((hash = !hash)) {
                out [i] = -1;
                index --;
            }
            else {  
                out [i] = index + 1;
                sprintf (tmp, "%lld", out [i]);
                index -= strnlen (tmp, MAX_LENGTH);
            }
            i ++;
        }
        for (;i --;) {
            if (out [i] == -1) {
                printf ("#");
            }
            else {
                printf ("%lld", out [i]);
            }
        }
        printf ("\n");

        free (out);
    }
    return (0);
}
~~~~

We use a string `tmp` to write a number into (as a string), so we
know how many characters it requires. 22 characters are enough to
store a 64 bit signed integer, hence `tmp` is a 23 character string
(so we have room for a terminating `NUL` character.)

### Lua
Lua follows a similar algorithm as we used is most other languages:

~~~~
for index in io . lines () do
    index = tonumber (index)
    out = {}
    hash = false
    i = 0
    while index > 0 do
        hash = not hash
        i = i + 1
        if  hash then
            out [i] = "#"
            index = index - 1
        else
            out [i] = index + 1
            index = index - tostring (index + 1) : len ()
        end
    end  
    for j = i, 1, -1 do
        io . write (out [j])
    end
    io . write ("\n")
end
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Node.js
A similar program in Node.js. It has `reverse` and `join`, so we
do not have to walk over the array to print it out piecewise:

~~~~
require ('readline')
. createInterface ({input: process . stdin})
. on ('line', _ => make_hash (+ _))
;

function make_hash (index) {
    let out = [] 
    let hash = false 
    while (index > 0) {  
        if (hash = !hash) {  
            out . push ("#")
            index --
        }
        else {
            out . push (index + 1)
            index -=   (index + 1) . toString () . length
        }
    }  
    console . log (out . reverse () . join (""))
}
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Python
Python has a `reverse` and a `join`, but the `reverse` reverses the
array in place; we can't use its return value. `join` is a method
to be called on the separator, not on the array.

~~~~
import fileinput

for index in fileinput . input ():
    index = int (index)
    out = []
    hash = 0
    while index > 0:
        hash = not hash
        if hash:
            out . append ("#")
            index = index - 1
        else:
            out . append (str (index + 1))
            index = index - len (str (index + 1))
    out . reverse ()
    print ("" . join (out))
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Ruby
The solution in Ruby is very similar to the one in Perl, except
that we need some explicit conversions between strings and integers:

~~~~
ARGF . each_line do |_|
    index = _ . to_i
    out = Array . new  
    hash = false
    while index > 0 do
        if hash = !hash
            out . push ("#")
            index -= 1
        else
            out . push ((index + 1) . to_s)
            index -=    (index + 1) . to_s . length
        end
    end
    puts (out . reverse . join)
end
~~~~
