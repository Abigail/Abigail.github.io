# Perl Weekly Challenge 120: Swap Odd/Even bits

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-120/#TASK1)

> You are given a positive integer `$N` less than or equal to `255`.
> 
> Write a script to swap the odd positioned bit with even positioned
> bit and print the decimal equivalent of the new binary representation.

### Example

>     Input: $N = 101
>     Output: 154
>
> Binary representation of the given number is `01 10 01 01`.
> The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is `10 01 10 10`.
> The decimal equivalent of `10011010` is `154`.
> 
>     Input: $N = 18
>     Output: 33
>
> Binary representation of the given number is `00 01 00 10`.
> The new binary representation after the odd/even swap is `00 10 00 01`.
> The decimal equivalent of `100001` is `33`.

## Solutions

This is almost the same exercise as [last week's](week-119-1.html).
We just have to swap a different set of bits.


If we take a number not exceeding \(255\), and look at its binary
representation, we have:

\[ b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0 \]

Swapping the odd positioned bits with the even positioned bits, we get:

\[ b_6 b_7 b_4 b_5 b_2 b_3 b_0 b_1 \]

Now, we could take the number, get a binary representation, 
swap the two sets of bits using a regular expression or substrings, 
and turn this back into a decimal number.

But we can achieve the same things by manipulating the bits
directly. To do this, we first split the original number,
which will call \(N\), into two parts:

\[ \begin{array}{cccccccc|rcl}
b_7 & 0   & b_5 & 0   & b_3 & 0   & b_1 & 0   &
       (N & \& & \text{0x55}) \\\\
0   & b_6 & 0   & b_4 & 0   & b_2 & 0   & b_0 &
       (N & \& & \text{0xAA}) \\\\ \hline
b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 &
          &    &
            \end{array} \]


We can now shift each part one bit the right or left:

\[ \begin{array}{cccccccc|rclcc}
0   & b_7 & 0   & b_5 & 0   & b_3 & 0   & b_1 &
       (N & \& & \text{0x55}) & >> & 1 \\\\
b_6 & 0   & b_4 & 0   & b_2 & 0   & b_0 & 0   &
       (N & \& & \text{0xAA}) & << & 1 \\\\ \hline
b_6 & b_7 & b_4 & b_5 & b_2 & b_3 & b_0 & b_2 &
          &    &              &    &
            \end{array} \]


We can now use a bitwise-or (`|`) or just plain addition to of
the three parts above to get the final result.

Our solutions looks a lot like the ones in the previous week;
only the languages lacking bitwise operations looks slightly
different.

#### No bitwise operations

For languages lacking bitwise operations, we will not be manipulating
the bits. Instead, we will treat the number as a sum of powers of \(2\):

\[ N = \sum_{i = 0}^7 b_i 2^i, 0 \leq b_i \leq 1 \]

We can split this into two groups:

\[ N = \sum_{i = 0, i \text{ odd}}^7  b_i 2^i +
       \sum_{j = 0, j \text{ even}}^7 b_j 2^j \]

We can now multiply the first group by \(2\), while we divide
the second group by \(2\), to get our wanted answer \(N'\):

\[ N' = \left(\sum_{i = 0, i \text{ odd}}^7  b_i 2^i\right) \div 2 +
        \left(\sum_{j = 0, j \text{ even}}^7 b_j 2^j\right) *    2 \]

Which we can rewrite as:

\[ N' = \sum_{i = 0, i \text{ odd}}^7  b_i 2^{i - 1} + 
        \sum_{j = 0, j \text{ even}}^7 b_j 2^{j + 1} \]

and

\[ N' = \sum_{i = 0}^7 b_i 2^{i \% 2 = 1 \text{ ? } i - 1 \text{ : } i + 1} \]

### Perl

With the input number in `$_`:
~~~~
say + ($_ & 0x55) << 1 | ($_ & 0xAA) >> 1

### Other languages with bitwise operations

Our implementations in [Bash](#github), [C](#github), [Go](#github),
[Java](#github), [Node.js](#github), [Pascal](#github), [Python](#github),
[R](#github), [Ruby](#github), [Scheme](#github) and [Tcl](#github) are
very similar to our Perl implementation. 

### AWK

AWK doesn't have bitwise operations. So, we're using arithmetic to
get the powers of `2` the number is composed off. Each power of
`2` is either multiplied by `2` or divided by `2`, depending on whether
the power is even or odd.

This leads to:
~~~~
{
    out = 0
    num = $1
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i ++) {
        bit = int ((num - (num % 2 ^ i)) / 2 ^ i) % 2;
        if (bit) {
            out += 2 ^ (i + (i % 2 ? -1 : 1))
        }
    }
    print out
}

### bc

There are not bitwise operations in bc either. So we're using a similar
solution as the AWK solution. With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
out = 0
for (i = 0; i < 8; i ++) {
    bit = ((num - (num % 2 ^ i)) / 2 ^ i) % 2
    if (bit == 1) {
        if (i % 2 == 1) {
            out += 2 ^ (i - 1)
        }
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            out += 2 ^ (i + 1)
        }
    }
}
out
~~~~

### Lua

The lua solution is very similar to the AWK solution. With the input
number in `num`, we have:

~~~~
out = 0
for i = 0, 7 do
    bit = math . floor ((num - (num % (2 ^ i))) / (2 ^ i)) % 2
    if bit == 1
    then
        if i % 2 == 1
        then
            out = out + 2 ^ (i - 1)
        else
            out = out + 2 ^ (i + 1)
        end
    end
end
print (out)
