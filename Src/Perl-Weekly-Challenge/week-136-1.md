# Perl Weekly Challenge 136: Two Friendly

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
You are given 2 positive numbers, `$m` and `$n`.

Write a script to find out if the given two numbers are *Two Friendly*.

>>>>
Two positive numbers, m and n are two friendly when
\(\text{gcd }(m, n) = 2^p\) where \(p > 0\). The greatest common divisor
(gcd) of a set of numbers is the largest positive number that divides all
the numbers in the set without remainder.

### Example 1

~~~~
Input: $m = 8, $n = 24
Output: 1

Reason: gcd(8,24) = 8 = 2^3
~~~~

### Example 2

~~~~
Input: $m = 26, $n = 39
Output: 0

Reason: gcd(26,39) = 13
~~~~

### Example 3

~~~~
Input: $m = 4, $n = 10
Output: 1

Reason: gcd(4,10) = 2 = 2^1

## Solution

We need to do two things: calculate the greatest common divisor, and
determine whether a number is a power of 2.

### Greatest Common Divisor

Calculating the greatest common divisor is something we have done
several times in previous weeks. So we will just copy its code.

For most languages, we use [Stein's algorithm](#wiki:Binary_GCD_algorithm).

Here is Stein's algorithm in C:

~~~~
long long gcd (long long u, long long v) {
    long long u_odd = u % 2;
    long long v_odd = v % 2;

    return u == v || !v     ? u
         :           !u     ? v
         : !u_odd && !v_odd ? gcd (u >> 1, v >> 1) << 1
         : !u_odd &&  v_odd ? gcd (u >> 1, v)
         :  u_odd && !v_odd ? gcd (u,      v >> 1)
         :  u     >   v     ? gcd (u - v,  v)
         :                    gcd (v - u,  u);
}
~~~~

and here it is in Scheme:

~~~~
(define (gcd u v)
    (define u_odd (= (modulo u 2) 1))
    (define v_odd (= (modulo v 2) 1))
    (cond ((= u v) u)
          ((= u 0) v)
          ((= v 0) u)
          ((and (not u_odd) (not v_odd)) (ash (gcd (ash u -1) (ash v -1)) 1))
          ((and (not u_odd)      v_odd)       (gcd (ash u -1)      v))
          ((and      u_odd  (not v_odd))      (gcd      u     (ash v -1)))
          ((> u v)                            (gcd (- u v) v))
          (else                               (gcd (- v u) u)))
)
~~~~

A few languages don't have bit shifting operations. In those languages,
we implemented a recursive version of 
[Euclids algorithm](#wiki:Euclidean_algorithm#Implementations).

As an example, we will show the implementation in Lua:

~~~~
function gcd (a, b)
    if b >  a then return gcd (b, a) end
    if b == 0 then return a          end
                   return gcd (b, a % b)
end
~~~~

### Power of 2?

To find out whether a number is a power of 2, we repeatedly divide
that number by 2, until we cannot evenly the number by 2 again.
If we end with the number being 1, the original was a power of 2.
Otherwise, it is not.

We can generalize this, by using a method `is_power_of_n`, which
takes two arguments, `number` and `n`, and which returns true if
\(\text{number} = n^p\) for some non-negative integer p.

We define this function recursively:

* if `number` is less than `1`, we return false.
* if `number` equals `1`, we return true, as \(n^0 = 1\) for all \(n \neq 0\).
* if `number % n` is not `0`, we return false, as we cannot
  evenly divide `number` by `n`.
* otherwise, we recurse calling `is_power_of_n` with `number / n` and `n`
  as arguments.

We also create a wrapper function `is_power_of_2`, which takes one
argument `number`, and just calls `is_power_of_n (number, 2)`.

Here is an example implementation in R:

~~~~
is_power_of_n <- function (number, n) {
         if (number <  1)      {FALSE}
    else if (number == 1)      {TRUE}
    else if (number %% n != 0) {FALSE}
    else                       {is_power_of_n (number / n, n)}
}

is_power_of_2 <- function (number) {
    is_power_of_n (number, 2)
}
~~~~

and an implementation in Tcl:

~~~~
proc is_power_of_n {number n} {
    if {$number <  1} {return 0}
    if {$number == 1} {return 1}
    if {$number % $n} {return 0}
                       return [is_power_of_n [expr $number / $n] $n]
}

proc is_power_of_2 {number} {
    return [is_power_of_n $number 2]
}
~~~~

### Tying it all together

What's rest is just a few lines of code which read in the data,
calls the two functions, and prints the result. Note that if the
greatest common divisor equals `1`, this is a power of `2`, 
but it's not a two friendly, so we check for that.

This is the Perl code tying it together:

~~~~
while (<>) {
    my  $r = gcd split;
    say $r > 1 && is_power_of_2 ($r) ? 1 : 0
}
~~~~

And here is how we do this in Lua:

~~~~
for line in io . lines () do
    local _, _, n, m = line : find ("([0-9]+)%s+([0-9]+)")
    local r = gcd (tonumber (n), tonumber (m))
    if r > 1 and is_power_of_2 (r) then
        print (1)
    else
        print (0)
    end
end
~~~~
