# Perl Weekly Challenge 150: Fibonacci Words

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
You are given two strings having same number of digits, `$a` and `$b`.

Write a script to generate `Fibonacci Words` by concatenation of the previous two strings. Finally print 51st digit of the first term having at least 51 digits.
<<<<

### Example:

~~~~
    Input: $a = '1234' $b = '5678'
    Output: 7

    Fibonacci Words:

    '1234'
    '5678'
    '12345678'
    '567812345678'
    '12345678567812345678'
    '56781234567812345678567812345678'
    '1234567856781234567856781234567812345678567812345678'

    The 51st digit in the first term having at least 51 digits '1234567856781234567856781234567812345678567812345678' is 7.

## Discussion

I don't see how the given that the input strings having the same number
of digits is going to buy us anything (except that having a lookup table
becomes feasible). And the fact that the input strings only contain
digits is useful for only one thing: it makes a bc solution possible.

## Solution

This is fairly trivial. We'll just keep concatenating strings until
we have reached the required length, then print the right character.

### Perl

With the input in `$_`, we first split the input into two strings:

~~~~
my ($fib_prev, $fib_last) = /[0-9]+/g;
~~~~

Now we iterate:

~~~~
my $LENGTH = 51;
while (length ($fib_last) < $LENGTH) {
    ($fib_prev, $fib_last) = ($fib_last, $fib_prev . $fib_last);
}
~~~~

And we print the right character:

~~~~
say substr $fib_last, $LENGTH - 1, 1;

### Bash

In Bash, we cannot assign multiple variables at the same time, So
we need an additional variable in the main loop.

~~~~
LENGTH=51

while read fib_prev fib_last
do   while ((${#fib_last} < LENGTH))
     do  fib_tmp=$fib_last
         fib_last=$fib_prev$fib_last
         fib_prev=$fib_tmp
     done
     echo ${fib_last:$((LENGTH - 1)):1}
done

### bc

Bc doesn't do string operations (other than printing string literals).
So, we have to work hard to "concatenate" strings consisting of numbers.
We do this by repeatedly multiplying one of the strings by 10, until we
have clear enough space for the other number to be added:

~~~~
fib_prev = read ()
if (fib_prev == 0) {
    break
}
fib_last = read ()
if (fib_last == 0) {
    break
}

while (fib_last < 10 ^ 51) {
    fib_tmp = fib_last
    t = fib_last
    fib_last = fib_prev
    while (t > 0) {
        fib_last = fib_last * 10
        t = t / 10
    }
    fib_last = fib_last + fib_tmp
    fib_prev = fib_tmp
}

while (fib_last > 10 ^ 51) {
    fib_last = fib_last / 10
}

fib_last % 10
~~~~

### Scheme

In Scheme, recursion is preferred over assignment. So, we define
a recursive method to concatenate string until the required length,
then print the right character:

~~~~
(define (fib fib_prev fib_last)
    (if (>= (string-length fib_last) 51)
        (format #t "~c\n" (string-ref fib_last 50))
        (fib fib_last (string-concatenate (list fib_prev fib_last)))))
~~~~

And a main program to read input, can call the method above:

~~~~
(define (main)
    (define line (read-line))
    (if (not (eof-object? line))
        (begin
            (fib (list-ref (string-split line #\ ) 0)
                 (list-ref (string-split line #\ ) 1))
            (main))))

(main)
