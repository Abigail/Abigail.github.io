# Perl Weekly Challenge 131: Find Pairs

## [Challenge][task2]
>>>>
You are given a string of delimiter pairs and a string to search.

Write a script to return two strings, the first with any characters matching the &ldquo;opening character&rdquo; set, the second with any matching the &ldquo;closing character&rdquo; set.
<<<<

### Example 1

~~~~
Input:
    Delimiter pairs: ""[]()
    Search String: "I like (parens) and the Apple ][+" they said.

Output:
    "(["
    ")]"
~~~~

### Example 2

~~~~
Input:
    Delimiter pairs: **//<>
    Search String: /* This is a comment (in some languages) */ <could be a tag>

Output:
    /**/<
    /**/>
~~~~

## Discussion

What a strange way to phrase the exercise. The entire "delimiter pairs"
is a red herring. We are not asked to do anything with delimiting pairs.
This is clear from both examples. Take for instance the first example;
the first delimiting pair using `"` for both the opening delimiter and
the closing delimiter. And the string to search in, uses a single pair
of double quotes as delimiting pair. Yet, the pair appears in both the
output strings.

So, basically we are given a string, and two sets of characters we need
to extract from the string, and for some perverse reason, the two sets
of characters are interleaved. Weird.

### Perl

First, we read the input. First line of input are the interleaved sets
of characters to extract - second line of input is the string we want
to search:

~~~~
chomp (my $chars = <>);
$_ = <>;
~~~~

We remove the newline from the first line we read; there is no need to
bother to remove it from the second line.

We now extract the characters from `$char` in the odd and even positions,
giving us two sets of characters. We do this by removing the characters
on the even and odd positions from `$char`; and since we use the `/r`
modifier, `$char` itself is unmodified, and the modified string is
returned. We also escape any slashes in the sets (for reasons which will
soon be clear).

~~~~
my $odds = $chars =~ s/(.)./$1/gr =~ s!([/\\])!\\$1!r;
my $even = $chars =~ s/.(.)/$1/gr =~ s!([/\\])!\\$1!r;
~~~~

We can now use `y///dc` to remove any characters which aren't in the
sets we need to extract -- this leaves use with the characters we need
to extract. Since `y///` doesn't do interpolation, we use [`eval`](#).
And this explains why we need to escape any slashes above.

~~~~
say eval "y/$odds//dcr";
say eval "y/$even//dcr";
~~~~
