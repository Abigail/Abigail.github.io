# Perl Weekly Challenge 104: NIM Game

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-104/#TASK2)

> Write a script to simulate the NIM Game.
> 
> It is played between 2 players. For the purpose of this task,
> let assume you play against the machine.
> 
> There are 3 simple rules to follow:
>
> * You have 12 tokens
> * Each player can pick 1, 2 or 3 tokens at a time
> * The player who picks the last token wins the game

## Discussion
This is **not** the well known [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)
game, which starts with multiple non-empty heaps, and players take
one or more tokens from a single heap (players can take all the
tokens of a heap). The player taking the last token loses.

Wikipedia calls the game described above as the [subtraction
game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#The_subtraction_game), and
presents it as a variation of Nim, although it acknowledges that
the game is sometimes also called Nim.

The subtraction game is pretty boring. The second player has a
winning strategy if, and only if, \(N \equiv 0 (\text{mod } k + 1)\)
where \(N\) is the number of tokens the game starts with, and \(k\)
is the maximum number of tokens one can
take during their turn. In that case, the strategy for the second
player is simple: on each turn, if the second player takes \(l\) tokens,
the second player takes \(k + 1 - l\) tokens. By using this strategy, the
second player guarantees that after each of her turns,
\(N \equiv 0 (\text{mod } k + 1)\), until \(N = 0\),
which makes her win the game.

If, at the start of the game, we have \(N \equiv m (\text{mod } k + 1)\),
for some \(1 \leq m \leq k\), the first player has a winning strategy:
in his first move, he takes \(m\) tokens,
making \(N \equiv 0 (\text{mod } k + 1)\).
He then follows the strategy of the second player explained above.

With the given parameters, the game is a win for the second player,
and the second player always wins on the third move.

## Solution
We will create a simple interactive game. We ask the user how many
tokens she wants to take (lets call this amount `t`), and then take
(`4 - t`) tokens ourselves. This leaves `8` tokens after the first
move, `4` tokens after the second move, and `0` after the third move.
At that moment, we declare victory.

If the player enters an invalid move, we don't do anything, and just ask again.

### Perl
We will be using a simple while loop: as long as there are tokens
left, we ask how many tokens the player wants to take -- showing
many tokens are left. We validate the input, and if correct, we
show many tokens the computer takes. We then update the number of
tokens, and repeat.

### BASIC
No `WHILE` in the BASIC dialect we're using, but we have `GOTO`.
There is no explicit `GOTO` in the program, but if the `THEN` part
of an `IF` statement contains just a number, it's treated as a
`GOTO`.

### Befunge-93
Although the code looks very different, we're still following a
similar algorithm as in the solutions above. We do however hard
code the response (on an input of `1`, we take `3` tokens; on an
input of `2`, we take `2` tokens; on an input of `3`, we take `1`
token, on any other number of tokens, we repeat the question). And
we have hardcoded the number of tokens subtracted in each round
(`4`). When victory has been declared, the program ends at the
bottom right (`@`).

Note that we're going through the fixed strings right to left, and
printing them with a bunch of `,`'s, which we go through left to right.

### Scheme
For our Scheme solution, we're using a recursive method. We're
defining a method `play`, which take the number of tokens left as
argument. If the number of tokens is 0, it declares victory.
Otherwise, it asks the player how many tokens the player wants to
take, displays the number of tokens the computer it going to take,
and then it calls itself with an updated number of tokens. If the
player inputs an invalid number of tokens, the method just calls
itself with the original number of tokens.
