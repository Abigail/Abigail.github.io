# Perl Weekly Challenge 106: Decimal String

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-106/#TASK2)

> You are given numerator and denominator i.e. `$N` and `$D`.
> 
> Write a script to convert the fraction into decimal string.
> If the fractional part is recurring then put it in parenthesis.

### Examples
~~~~
Input: $N = 1, $D = 3
Output: "0.(3)"

Input: $N = 1, $D = 2
Output: "0.5"

Input: $N = 5, $D = 66
Output: "0.0(75)"

## Discussion
It is very tempting to just divide the given numbers, use
`sprintf` to get lots of digits, and then search a pattern
which repeats.

But in most languages, this is not going to work, due to 
floating point arithmetic not being precise enough. It goes
wrong with surprisingly low numbers.

For instance, \\(\frac{1}{23} = 0.\overline{0434782608695652173913}\\),
but (in Perl), `printf "%.40f" => 1/23` gives
`0.0434782608695652173907151075149535301989`. This disagrees
with the real result shortly after the 20th digit, and we don't
even get the repeating part correctly in its first occurance.

Instead, we have to perform long division by hand. First, we
calculate \\(I = \lfloor \frac{N}{D} \rfloor\\) and set \\(N = N \bmod D\\).
\\(I\\) is going to be the integer part (the part before the
[decimal separator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator))
of our solution.

Now, in a loop, we calculate the digits after the decimal separator.
As an invariant, we have \\(N < D\\). We'll have string \\(s\\) which
we use to create the decimal string -- we initialize \\(r\\) as
\\(I\\) followed by a dot (our decimal separator). We also keep track
of a position \\(p\\), and we initialize \\(p\\) as the length of
the string \\(r\\). We'll also have a hash \\(S\\); initially empty.

In each iteration of the loop, we first check whether \\(N\\) is zero.
If so, the decimal expansion of the fraction is finite, and \\(r\\)
is the final result of the process. Otherwise, we add \\(N\\) to the
hash \\(S\\), with value \\(p\\). We can now find a new digit
to be added to \\(r\\). We do this by calculating
\\(d = \lfloor \frac{10 \cdot N}{D} \rfloor\\). Since \\(N < D\\), 
\\(0 \leq d < 10\\). \\(d\\) is the new digit to be added to \\(r\\).
We then update \\(N\\) by setting \\(N = 10 \cdot N \bmod D\\).
The long division equivalent of this is process of *dropping a zero*,
and then calculating how often \\(D\\) divides the new number, and then
subtracting that many times \\(D\\) from the number. Finally, we
increment \\(p\\) by one -- after all, we added a digit to \\(r\\).

The guard of our loop is \\(N \notin S\\); if we have an \\(N\\)
which is already in \\(S\\), the decimal expansion of the fraction
repeats, and the value of \\(N\\) in \\(S\\) is the position where
it starts repeating (and it repeats till the end of \\(r\\)).
We can use this value to place the required parenthesis.

This algorithm is based on the one found on the Wikipedia page about
[repeating decimals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal).

         0                      int (7 / 22) == 0, so 0 before decimal point

          --                                          |  Same, so '18'
          18                    N = (10 * N) % D      |  is the repeating

## Solutions

Given the algorithm described above, the implementations in the
various languages follows easily. 

### Perl
~~~~
sub long_division ($numerator, $denominator) {
    my $BASE     = 10;
    my $fraction = sprintf "%d." => $numerator / $denominator;
    my $position = length $fraction;
    my %seen;

    $numerator  %= $denominator;
    
    while (!$seen {$numerator}) {
        return $fraction unless   $numerator;  # No repeating part.
        $seen {$numerator} = $position;
        $fraction .= int ($BASE * $numerator / $denominator);
        $numerator =      $BASE * $numerator % $denominator;
        $position ++;
    }

    #
    # Place parens around the repetend part.
    #
    $fraction .= ")";
    substr $fraction, $seen {$numerator}, 0, "(";

### AWK
Almost the same function in AWK.

    position = length (fraction)
    delete seen
          
    numerator %= denominator
          
    while (!seen [numerator]) {
        if (!numerator) {
            return fraction
        }
        seen [numerator] = position
        fraction  = fraction int (base * numerator / denominator)
        numerator =               base * numerator % denominator
        position ++
    }

    return substr (fraction, 1,  seen [numerator]) "(" \
           substr (fraction, 1 + seen [numerator]) ")"

### Bash
~~~~
function long_division () {
    declare numerator=$1
    declare denominator=$2
    declare BASE=10
    fraction=$((numerator / denominator)).
    declare position=${#fraction}
    declare -a seen
    
    ((numerator %= denominator))

    while ((!seen[numerator]))
    do  if   ((numerator == 0))
        then return
        fi
        seen[$numerator]=$position
        fraction=$fraction$((BASE * numerator / denominator))
        ((numerator =        BASE * numerator % denominator))
        ((position ++))
    done
    fraction=${fraction::${seen[$numerator]}}\(${fraction:${seen[$numerator]}}\)
}

The Bash solution is very similar to the Perl solution, but it does
have some syntax oddities. There are no named parameters in Bash,
function arguments are available in `$1`, `$2`, etc. We cannot return
strings from functions, so we write to a global variable, `fraction`.

The `((EXPR))` construct evaluates `EXPR` as arithmetic; `$((EXPR))`
also evaluates `EXPR` as arithmetic, but then it replaces the 
result in the expression it is. 

String concatenation is done by just placing the parts you want to
concatenate next to each other, so `fraction=$((numerator / denominator)).`
divides `numerator` by `denominator` (division in Bash is integer division),
and concatenates that result with a dot (`.`), placing the result in
`fraction`.

`${#EXPR}` evaluates `EXPR`, and then it takes the length of the result.

To get a substring in Bash, you use the `${EXPR1:EXPR2:EXPR3}` construct;
this gets the substring of `EXPR1`, starting from position `EXPR2`, and
with length `EXPR3`. If `EXPR2` is empty (or zero), the substring is taken
from the beginning of the `EXPR1`. If `EXPR3` is empty (and the second colon
is missing), the substring is taken till the end of `EXPR1`.

Therefore, the last statement places the parenthesis on the right places.

### C

algorithm. Allocating memory takes work, and inserting
parenthesis requires shifting characters one by one.

### Python
Python has two division operators: `/` which does regular division,
and `//` which does integer division. I wish more languages had
different operators for the different types of division.

Taking a substring in Python is done by using a slice operation.

Blocks in Python are done by indentation. Hated by many, but I can
appreciate the charm of it. It makes for more condense code.

    BASE      = 10
