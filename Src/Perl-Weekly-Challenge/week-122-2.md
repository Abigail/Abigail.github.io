## Discussion

The [Tribonacci
Numbers](#wiki:Generalizations_of_Fibonacci_numbers#Tribonacci_numbers)
are defined as follows:

\[ \mathcal{T}(n) = \begin{cases}
     0  & \text{if } n \leq 1 \\\\
     1  & \text{if } n = 2 \\\\
     \mathcal{T}(n - 3) + \mathcal{T}(n - 2) + \mathcal{T}(n - 1) &
         \text{if } n > 2
   \end{cases} \]

This sequence is found at the OEIS as [A000073](#oeis).

There is a formula to calculate \(\mathcal{T}(n)\) directly, in
a similar was there is one for the Fibonacci numbers:

\[ \mathcal{T}(n) = \left\lfloor
   \frac{3 \left(\sqrt[3]{586 + 102\sqrt{33}}\right)
           \left(\frac{1}{3}(\sqrt[3]{19 + 3\sqrt{33}} +
                             \sqrt[3]{19 - 3\sqrt{33}} + 1)\right)^n}
        {\left(\sqrt[3]{586 + 102\sqrt{33}}\right)^2 -
              2\sqrt[3]{586 + 102\sqrt{33}} + 4}
\right\rceil \]

Now, the number of ways to decompose a non-negative integer \(N\) as a sum
of `1`s, `2`s, and `3`s, is equal to \(\mathcal{T}(N + 2)\).

But we don't have to calculate the number of ways to decompose a score,
we actually have to calculate all the different ways to decompose
a given score.

The definition of the Tribonacci Numbers gives us a way to calculate
the all the different decompositions. Let \(\mathcal{S}(n)\) be the
set of all decompositions of a score of \(n - 2\). Then

\[ \mathcal{S}(n) = \begin{cases}
   \emptyset & \text{if } n \leq 1,   \\\\
   \\{ \text{""} \\} & \text{if } n = 2 \\\\
   \\{ \forall x \in \mathcal{S}(n - 1): \text{"1"} \odot x \\} \; \cup & \\\\
   \\{ \forall x \in \mathcal{S}(n - 2): \text{"2"} \odot x \\} \; \cup &
                                                         \text{if } n > 2 \\\\
   \\{ \forall x \in \mathcal{S}(n - 3): \text{"3"} \odot x \\}         &
   \end{cases} \]

where \(\odot\) is the concatenation operator.

That is, we can decompose a score of \(n\) by either first scoring a \(1\)
and then decomposing a score of \(n - 1\), or first scoring a \(2\) and
then decomposing a score of \(n - 2\), or first scoring a \(3\) and then
decomposing a score of \(n - 3\).

The definition given above suggests using a recursive solution. This is
possible, but instead, we will be using an iterative solution.

## Solutions

We will reading the `n` from standard input.

### Perl

We start off by initializing the first three sets, \(\mathcal{S}(0), 
\mathcal{S}(1), \mathcal{S}(2)\):

~~~~
my @s = ([], [], [""]);
~~~~

Thus two empty sets, and a set consisting of an empty string.

We now repeatedly (`n` times) add a next set, using the last three
sets:
~~~~
map {push @s => [map {my $s = $_; map {"$s $_"} @{$s [-$s]}} 1 .. 3]} 1 .. <>;
~~~~

We can rewrite this using nested `for` loops instead of `map`s to make
it clear what is happening:

~~~~
for (1 .. <>) {
    my @new;
    for my $s (1 .. 3) {
        for my $decomposition (@{$s [-$s]}) {
            push @new => "$s $decomposition";
        }
    }
    push @s => \@new;
}
~~~~

A new set is created by taking all the decompositions for the last
three sets, and prepending them with `1`, `2`, or `3`.

At the end, we have to print the elements of the last set:
~~~~
say for @{$s [-1]}
~~~~

### AWK

We will be using two arrays, `c`, and `s`. `s [i]` will contain
all the decompositions of a score of `i`, while `c [i]` will contain
the number of decompositions of a score of `i`.

First, the initialization:

~~~~
c [0] = 0
c [1] = 0
c [2] = 1
s [2, 0] = ""
~~~~

We can now repeatedly add new entries to `s` and `c`. Note that we have
`n` in `$1`:

~~~~
for (i = 3; i < $1 + 3; i ++) {
    c [i] = 0
    for (j = 1; j <= 3; j ++) {
        for (k = 0; k < c [i - j]; k ++) {
            s [i, c [i]] = j " " s [i - j, k]
            c [i] ++
        }
    }
}
~~~~

Finally, we print the result:
~~~~
for (k = 0; k < c [$1 + 2]; k ++) {
    print s [$1 + 2, k]
}
~~~~

### Bash

For our Bash solution, we need a trick. Bash doesn't have multidimensional
arrays. We could have used a concatenated key, and an associative array,
but we do something else instead. Instead of having an array of sets,
we use an array of strings; each string has all the decompositions 
concatenated together; and each decomposition starts with a newline.
(So, the newline acts as a separator, but there is an extra newline
at the beginning).

The initialization:
~~~~
declare scores
l=$'\n'
scores[2]=$l
~~~~
`l=$'\n'` is a little trick to get a string consisting of just a newline
into a variable.

We can now repeatedly add a new entry to `scores`:
~~~~
for ((i = 3; i < n + 3; i ++))
do  for ((j = 1; j <= 3; j ++))
    do  scores[$i]=${scores[$i]}${scores[$((i - j))]//$l/$l$j }
    done
done
~~~~

The interesting part is: `${scores[$((i - j))]//$l/$l$j }`. `i` is the
index of new entry, and `j` is `1`, `2`, or `3`, so `${scores[$((i - j))]}`
is one of the last three entries. We then use a regular expression to
prepend `j` to each of the decompositions. The general syntax is:
`${word//pattern/replacement}`. This takes `$word`, and replaces each
non-overlapping occurance of `pattern` with `replacement`, returning
the result. The Perl equivalent would be: `$word =~ s/pattern/replacement/gr`.

Printing the result is now simply -- we don't have to loop as the
decompositions are already separated by newlines. But we have to remove
the first newline:

~~~~
echo "${scores[$((n + 2))]/$l/}"
~~~~

Note that we have only a single slash before the pattern; this means
we only replace the first occurance.

### C

In C, we have to work hard! Since C doesn't have a way of find out
the size of an array, nor an efficient method to find the length
of a string, we will be using three arrays:

* `scores`, a two dimensional array of strings (which are pointers to `char`)
* `count`, which counts the number of decompositions for a specific score
* `lengths`, a two dimensional array, with the length of each of the
strings in `scores`.

We'll declare this as: 

~~~~
typedef long long number;
char  *** scores;
number  * count;
size_t ** lengths;
~~~~

Then we read our number `n`, and allocate space for the arrays:

~~~~
int n;
if (scanf ("%d", &n) != 1) {
    perror ("Unexpected input");
    exit (1);
}

if ((scores = (char ***) malloc ((n + 3) * sizeof (char **))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc scores failed");
    exit (1);
}
if ((count = (number *) malloc ((n + 3) * sizeof (number))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc count failed");
    exit (1);
}
if ((lengths = (size_t **) malloc ((n + 3) * sizeof (size_t *))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc lengths failed");
    exit (1);
}
~~~~

We can now initialize the first three entries, which requires more
allocating of memory:

~~~~
count [0] = 0;
count [1] = 0;
count [2] = 1;

if ((scores [2] = (char **) malloc (sizeof (char *))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc failed");
    exit (1);
}
if ((scores [2] [0] = (char *) malloc (sizeof (char))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc failed");
    exit (1);
}
if ((lengths [2] = (size_t *) malloc (sizeof (size_t))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc failed");
    exit (1);
}
scores  [2] [0] [0] = '\0';
lengths [2] [0]     =   0;
~~~~

We now start the loop in which we add new sets to `scores`:

~~~~
for (int i = 3; i < n + 3; i ++) {
~~~~

We start with calculating how many entries there will be in that
set (which is the sum of the sizes of the previous three sets),
and allocate memory for `scores [i]` and `lengths [i]`:

~~~~
count [i] = count [i - 1] + count [i - 2] + count [i - 3];
if ((scores [i] = (char **) malloc (count [i] * sizeof (char *)))
               == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc failed");
    exit (1);
}
if ((lengths [i] = (size_t *) malloc (count [i] * sizeof (size_t)))
               == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc failed");
    exit (1);
}
~~~~

It's only now that we can create the entries in the set. Each entry is
two character longer than the its "*parent*" entry: first a `1`, `2`,
or `3`, then a space, then a copy of an entry from one of the three
previous sets.

~~~~
number l = 0;
for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j ++) {
    for (int k = 0; k < count [i - j]; k ++) {
        lengths [i] [l] = 2 + lengths [i - j] [k];
        if ((scores [i] [l] = (char *) malloc
                   ((lengths [i] [l] + 1) * sizeof (char))) == NULL) {
            perror ("Malloc failed");
            exit (1);
        }
        scores [i] [l] [0] = j + '0';
        scores [i] [l] [1] = ' ';
        strncpy (scores  [i] [l] + 2, scores [i - j] [k],
                 lengths [i - j] [k]);
        scores [i] [l] [lengths [i] [l]] = '\0';

        l ++;
    }
}
~~~~

At the end of the loop, we can release some memory -- we don't need
the entry three steps back anymore:

~~~~
if (i - 3 > 1) {
    for (int k = 0; k < count [i - 3]; k ++) {
        free (scores [i - 3] [k]);
    }
    free (scores  [i - 3]);
    free (lengths [i - 3]);
}
~~~~

After we have created the final set, we can print its entries:

~~~~
for (int i = 0; i < count  [n + 2]; i ++) {
    printf ("%s\n", scores [n + 2] [i]);
}
~~~~

All what now needs to be done, is freeing memory:

~~~~
for (int i = n; i <= n + 2; i ++) {
    for (int k = 0; k < count [i]; k ++) {
        free (scores [i] [k]);
    }
    free (scores  [i]);
    free (lengths [i]);
}

free (scores);
free (lengths);
free (count);
~~~~

### Other languages

We have also solutions in [Lua](#github), [Node.js](#github),
[Python](#github) and [Ruby](#github), which are all similar
to our Perl solution.
