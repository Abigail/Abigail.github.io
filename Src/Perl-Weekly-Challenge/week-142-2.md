## Discussion

This is a stupid joke. 

Since Sleep Sort critically depends on sleeping with a low tolerance
on time slept, it cannot be implemented on most Unix systems, including
most Linux systems ([RTLinux](#wiki) being an exception). You need a
real time operating system.

I am not even aware of any real time operating system which runs perl.

Furthermore, a sleep sort implementation needs threads. I'm not going
to recompile perl to implement a stupid joke. And I'm certainly not
going to buy a box to run a real time OS on.

## Solution.

Nothing to see here. Please move on.
