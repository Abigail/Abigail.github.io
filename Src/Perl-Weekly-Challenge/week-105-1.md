# Perl Weekly Challenge 105: Nth root

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-105/#TASK1)

> You are given positive numbers `$N` and `$k`.
>
> Write a script to find out the `$N`th root of `$k`.
> For more information, please take a look at the
> [wiki page](#wiki:Nth_root#Computing_principal_roots).

### Examples
~~~~
Input: $N = 5, $k = 248832
Output: 12

Input: $N = 5, $k = 34
Output: 2.02

## Discussion
This is pretty straightforward. The \(\text{Nth}\) root of
\(k\), \(\sqrt[N]{k}\) is easily found by raising \(k\) to the power of
\(\frac{1}{N}\):

\[k^\frac{1}{N}\]

This solves the issue for languages which allow exponentation where
the exponent isn't an integer. Perl is one of these languages.

For languages which don't, we take the formula above; take the [natural
logarithm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NaturalLogarithm.html) of
it, and raise \({\bf e}\) to that:

\[k^\frac{1}{N} = {\bf e}^{\ln{k^\frac{1}{N}}} = {\bf e}^{\frac{\ln k}{N}}\]

This solves the problem for languages which have a `log` and an `exp` function.

## Solutions
We are assuming the input consists of one or more lines -- each line
consisting of two numbers (separated by white space): \(N\), and \(k\).
We will be outputting \(k^{\frac{1}{N}}\) for each line of input.

### Perl
In Perl, we can solve this with what basically is a one-liner:
~~~~
$_ = [split], say $$_ [1] ** (1 / $$_ [0]) while <>;
~~~~

We take a line of input, split it on white space, then we raise
the second number (\(k\)) to the power of the inverse of the first (\(N\)).

### Pascal
Pascal does not allow us to raise numbers to a non-integer power,
we we're taking the natural logarithm of \(k\), divide that by \(N\), and
raise \({\bf e}\) to the result of that:

~~~~
var N, k: double;
 
begin
    while not eof () do
    begin
        readln (N, k);
        writeln (exp (ln (k) / N) : 1 : 10);
    end
end.

### Other languages

We also have solutions in [AWK](#github), [bc](#github), [C](#github),
[Fortran](#github), [Lua](#github), [Node.js](#github), [Python](#github),
[Ruby](#github), [Scheme](#github), and [SQL](#github), using one
of the strategies explained above.
