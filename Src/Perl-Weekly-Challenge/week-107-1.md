# Perl Weekly Challenge 107: Self-descriptive Numbers

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-107/#TASK1)

> Write a script to display the first three self-descriptive numbers.
> As per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-descriptive_number),
> the definition of Self-descriptive Number is
> 
> > In mathematics, a self-descriptive number is an integer `m` that in
> > a given base `b` is `b` digits long in which each digit `d` at position
> > `n` (the most significant digit being at position `0` and the least
> > significant at position `b - 1`) counts how many instances of
> > digit `n` are in `m`.

### Example
`1210` is a four-digit self-descriptive number:

* position `0` has value `1` i.e. there is only one `0` in the number
* position `1` has value `2` i.e. there are two `1` in the number
* position `2` has value `1` i.e. there is only one `2` in the number
* position `3` has value `0` i.e. there is no `3` in the number

### Output
~~~~
1210, 2020, 21200

## Discussion

In essence, this is just a [`Hello, World!`](wiki:%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
program. We don't even need to go to the [OEIS](oeis:A138480) to find
the first three numbers -- the challenge tells us what the output is!

To still have a tiny bit of a challenge, we will derive what the
first three self-describing numbers are.

Let \(N_b\) be a self-describing number in base \(b\). \(N_b\) has \(b\)
digits: \(N = d_{0} d_{1} \ldots d_{b-1}\). We then have the following
observations:

1. \(0 < d_0\): we do not accept a leading \(0\).
2. \(b = \sum_{i=0}^{b-1} d_i\). This follows from the definition
   of a self-describing number: the sum of the digits must equal
   the number of digits, and the number of digits is \(b\).
3. \(\forall i: 0 \leq i \leq b - 1 \implies d_i < b - 1\).
   (\(N_b\) does not contain a digit which is the largest possible digit
   in base \(b\) ((\(b - 1\))). Suppose \(N_b\) does contain such a digit. 
   Then by point ii, \(N_b\) contains a \(1\), and all other digits
   are \(0\). If \(b = 2\) that would imply that \(N_2 = 11\), but
   \(11\) clearly is not self describing. Otherwise \(d_0 > 0\)
   (by point i); \(d_1 > 0\) (since \(N_b\) contains at least one
   \(1\)), and all other digits are \(0\). But that means that
   \(d_{b-1}\) is \(0\), which contradicts that \(N_b\) contains
   the digit \(b - 1\).
4. \(b > 2 \implies d_{b-1} = 0\) (The last digit is a \(0\)). This
    follows directly from point iii.
5. \(b > 4 \implies d_0 > 1\). (For bases larger than \(4\), the first
   digit cannot be a \(1\).) Suppose \(b > 4\), and \(d_0 = 1\). This
   means that \(N_b\) contains just a single \(0\), and this has to
   be \(d_{b-1}\) (by point iv). The digits \(d_1 \ldots d_{b-2}\)
   have to sum to \(b - 1\) (by point ii) which means that one of
   those digits is a \(2\), and the rest are \(1\)s. But then
   \(N_b\) contains \(b - 2\) \(1\)s, one \(2\) and one \(0\). And
   since \(b > 4\), \(b - 2 > 2\), so \(N_b\) cannot be self-describing.
6. \(b > 4 \implies d_0 < b - 2\). (For bases larger than \(4\),
   the first digit cannot be \(b - 2\)). Suppose we would have a
   self-describing number \(N_b\), with \(d_0 = b - 2\). That means
   that only one of the digits \(d_1, d_2, \cdots, d_{b-1}\) is non-zero.
   Let \(d_k\) be this non-zero digit. By point ii, \(d_k = 2\), and 
   by point i, \(k > 0\). But that implies that \(N_b\) contains
   the digit \(k\) twice. However, \(N_b\) contains the digit \(b - 2\)
   once (we did assume \(d_0 = b - 2\)), the digit \(2\) once, and 
   the digit \(0\), \(b - 2\) times. \(b > 4 \implies b - 2 > 2\), so
   the number cannot be self-describing.

We're now ready to derive the first three self-describing numbers.

1. There cannot be any self-describing numbers for base \(b = 1\). 
   The only digits in that base are \(0\), but we cannot have a
   leading \(0\).
2. For base \(2\), point i implies any \(N_2\)
   must start with a \(1\). But constradicts point iii, so we 
   cannot have a self-describing number in base \(2\).
3. For base \(3\), points i and iii imply that for any \(N_3\)
   \(d_0 = 1\) (the first digit). Point iv implies the number end
   with a \(0\), so \(d_2 = 0\). Then, by point ii, \(d_1 = 2\),
   but this contradicts point iii.
   So there cannot be any self-describing numbers in base \(3\).
4. For base \(4\), points ii and iii imply any \(N_4\) has
   \(d_0 = 1\) or \(d_0 = 2\). Point iv implies that \(d_3 = 0\).
    * If \\(d_0 = 1\\), then \\(d_1 + d_2 = 3\\), so one of them is
      \\(1\\), and the other \\(2\\). \\(d_1\\) cannot be \\(1\\),
      because it describes the number of \\(1\\)s in the number,
      and we have 2 of them. So, \\(d_1 = 2\\) and \\(d_2 = 1\\).
      This does not lead to any contractions, so the first
      self-describing number is \\(1210\\).
    * If \\(d_0 = 2\\), then \\(d_1 + d_2 = 2\\). If \\(d_1 = d_2 = 1\\),
      then we have two \\(1\\)s, but \\(d_1 = 1\\), so that would
      not be self-describing. Which leaves the possibility one of
      \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\) is \\(0\\), and the other \\(2\\).
      \\(d_1 = 2\\) is not going to work, as that would imply
      \\(N_4\\) has two \\(1\\)s &mdash; but there are none. If \\(d_1 = 0\\),
      we get \\(d_2 = 2\\), which does not lead to a contraction,
      so the second self-describing number is \\(2020\\).
5. For base \(5\), by points iii, v, and vi, we have one possiblity for
   the first digit: \(d_0 = 2\). That means any \(N_5\) contains
   contains two \(0\)s, including \(d_4\). Hence, \(d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 3\),
   with one of those digits being \(0\). The other two must therefore be
   \(1\), and \(2\). This means \(N_5\) contains two \(2\)s, so
   \(d_2 = 2\). There are no \(3\)s, so \(d_3 = 0\), and \(d_1 = 1\).
   This makes \(21200\) the third self-describing number.
