# Perl Weekly Challenge 147: Pentagon Numbers

## [Challenge][task2]
>>>>
Write a script to find the first pair of `Pentagon Numbers` whose sum and difference are also a `Pentagon Number`.

<blockquote>
Pentagon numbers can be defined as P(n) = n(3n - 1)/2.

</blockquote>
<<<<

### Example

~~~~
The first 10 Pentagon Numbers are:
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117 and 145.

P(4) + P(7) = 22 + 70 = 92 = P(8)
but
P(4) - P(7) = |22 - 70| = 48 is not a Pentagon Number.

## Discussion

Pentagonal numbers are sequence [A000326](#oeis) 
in [the on-line encyclopedia of integer sequences](https://oeis.org).
(Note that the OEIS has \(P (0) = 0\) as the first number).

To make life for ourselves a bit more spicy, we will try to solve this
challenge without making use of multiplication or division. In order to
do that, we will derive a formula for the next pentagonal number.

We define the n<sup>th</sup> pentagonal number as:

\[
    \mathcal{P} (n) = \frac{n \cdot (3 \cdot n - 1)}{2}
\] 

Then

\[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
       \mathcal{P} (n + 1)
       & = &   \frac{(n + 1) \cdot (3 \cdot (n + 1) - 1)}{2}                \\\\
       & = &   \frac{(n + 1) \cdot (3 \cdot n + 2)}{2}                      \\\\
       & = &   \frac{3 \cdot n \cdot n + 5 \cdot n + 2}{2}                  \\\\
       & = &   \frac{3 \cdot n \cdot n - n + 6 \cdot n + 2}{2}              \\\\
       & = &   \frac{n \cdot (3 \cdot n - 1) + 6 \cdot n + 2}{2}            \\\\
       & = &   \frac{n \cdot (3 \cdot n - 1)}{2} + \frac{6 \cdot n + 2}{2}  \\\\
       & = &   \mathcal{P} (n) + 3 \cdot n + 1                              \\\\
       & = &   \mathcal{P} (n) + n + n + n + 1
    \end{array}
\]

## Solution

In our solution, we will have a loop, where we process the next pentagonal,
`p`, number in each iteration. We will also keep a hash or array of all
previous pentagonal numbers.

For each previous pentagonal number `s` (with `s <= p / 2`),
we will check if both
`p - s` and `p - s - s` are pentagonal numbers. If so, we have the answer
as `s` and `p - s` are pentagonal numbers and so are their sum
(`s + p - s = p`) and difference (`p - s - s`). 

### Perl

We can write this in a compact way in Perl:

~~~~
my %pentagon;

MAIN: for (;;) {
    state $n = 0;
    state $p = 0;
    $pentagon {$p += $n + $n + $n ++ + 1} ++;

    $_ + $_ < $p && $pentagon  {$p - $_}
                 && $pentagon  {$p - $_ - $_}
                 && say ("$_ ", $p - $_)
                 && last MAIN for keys %pentagon;
}
~~~~

### C

Most languages nowadays have hashes, maps, dictionaries or something
else to store arbitrary keys and quickly find if a key is present.
C does not. Therefore, in our C solution, we keep track of previous
pentagonal numbers in an array. To find whether a number is present,
we use a binary search. We have wrapped this into a function:

~~~~
bool is_pentagonal (int candidate, int * pentagon, size_t max) {
    size_t low  = 0;
    size_t high = max;
    while (low < high) {
        size_t mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (pentagon [mid] == candidate) {return true;}
        if (pentagon [mid]  < candidate) {low  = mid + 1;}
        if (pentagon [mid]  > candidate) {high = mid;}
    }
    return false;
}
~~~~

Here, `candidate` is the number we're searching, `pentagon` is the array
we are searching in, and `max` is the number of elements in `pentagon`.

The main program uses the same algorithm as Perl. It's far more verbose,
because we have to do the memory management ourselves:

~~~~
int main (void) {
    int *  pentagon =  NULL;
    int    n        =     0;
    int    p        =     0;
    size_t cap      =   100;
    size_t high     =     0;
    bool   done     = false;

    if ((pentagon = (int *) malloc (cap * sizeof (int))) == NULL) {
        perror ("Malloc failed");
        return (1);
    }

    while (!done) {
        p += n + n + n + 1;
        n ++;
        if (high >= cap) {
            cap *= 2;
            if ((pentagon =
                     (int *) realloc (pentagon, cap * sizeof (int))) == NULL) {
                perror ("Realloc failed");
                return (1);
            }
        }
        pentagon [high ++] = p;

        for (size_t i = 0; i < high &&
                           pentagon [i] + pentagon [i] < p &&
                          !done; i ++) {
            int seen = pentagon [i];
            if (is_pentagonal (p - seen,        pentagon, high) &&
                is_pentagonal (p - seen - seen, pentagon, high)) {
                printf ("%d %d\n", seen, p - seen);
                done = true;
            }
        }
    }

    return (0);
}
