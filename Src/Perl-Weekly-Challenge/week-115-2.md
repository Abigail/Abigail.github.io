# Perl Weekly Challenge 115: Largest Multiple

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-115/#TASK2)

> You are given a list of positive integers (`0-9`), single digit.
> 
> Write a script to find the largest multiple of `2` that can be formed
> from the list.

### Examples
>     Input: @N = (1, 0, 2, 6)
>     Output: 6210
>     
>     Input: @N = (1, 4, 2, 8)
>     Output: 8412
>     
>     Input: @N = (4, 1, 7, 6)
>     Output: 7614

## Solutions

This is pretty simple. To get the highest possible number, we just 
list the digits, highest to lowest. To get the highest possible even
number, we take the smallest even digit, place it last, and list the
rest of the digits, highest to lowest.

We will bother sorting the digits -- in fact, we won't even store all
the digits. Instead, we will just count them.

### Perl
We will have the list of digits in `$_`. First, we count them:
~~~~
my @DIGITS = (0 .. 9);
my @EVENS  = grep {$_ % 2 == 0} @DIGITS;

my @digits = (0) x @DIGITS;
$digits [$_] ++ for do {local $" = ""; /[@DIGITS]/g}
~~~~
We then find the smallest even digit, and remove it from the count.
(If there is not even digit, we won't output anything):
~~~~
my ($last) = grep {$digits [$_]} @EVENS;
next unless defined $last;
$digits [$last] --;
~~~~

Now, print the digits highest to lowest, with the smallest even digit last:
~~~~
print join "" => map {$_ x $digits [$_]} reverse @DIGITS;
say $last;
~~~~

### Other languages

We also have implementations in [AWK](#github), [Bash](#github), [C](#github),
[Lua](#github), [Node.js](#github), [Python](#github) and [Ruby](#github)
which all work the same as the Perl solution.
