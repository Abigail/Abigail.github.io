# Perl Weekly Challenge 142: Divisor Last Digit

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
You are given positive integers, `$m` and `$n`.

Write a script to find total count of divisors of `$m` having last digit `$n`.

## Discussion

Given the first task of [last week][last-week], this is very boring. Last week,
we were asked to find the divisors of numbers, and report those who had
8 divisors. The [week before][last-last-week] we also had a task which
we solved by finding the divisors.

Hence, this week, we just give a minimal Perl solution, and won't
bother copy-and-pasting code for other languages.

## Solution

### Perl

~~~~
perl -MMath::Prime::Util=divisors -pale '$_ = grep {/$F[1]$/} divisors $F[0]'
~~~~

We read pairs of numbers from standard input, find the divisors of the
first number (`$F[0]`), filter those ending in the second number
(`$F[1]`), and print the amount (`-p` cause perl to print the content
of `$_`).
