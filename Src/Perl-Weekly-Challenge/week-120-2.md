# Perl Weekly Challenge 120: Clock Angle

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-120/#TASK2)

> You are given time `$T` in the format hh:mm.
>
> Write a script to find the smaller angle formed by the hands of an
> analog clock at a given time.<br>
> *HINT: A analog clock is divided up into `12` sectors.
> One sector represents 30 degree `(360/12 = 30)`.*

### Examples

>     Input: $T = '03:10'
>     Output: 35 degree
>
> The distance between the `2` and the `3` on the clock is `30` degree.
> For the `10` minutes i.e. `1/6` of an hour that have passed.
> The hour hand has also moved `1/6` of the distance between the `3` and
> the `4`, which adds `5` degree (`1/6` of `30`).
> The total measure of the angle is `35` degree.
>
>     Input: $T = '04:00'
>     Output: 120 degree


## Solution

The hint suggests we should calculate the angle the hour hand makes
(compared to some base line) and the angle the minute hand makes
(compared to the same base line), and calculate the difference.

We will be ignoring that.

In fact, we will not looking at any specific angle the hour or minute
hands are making. Instead, we will make use of the following observations:

1. At `00:00`, the hour hand and the minute hands align, that is,
   the angle between them is `0`&deg;.
2. Every minute, the angle between the hour and minute hand increases
   by `5.5`&deg;.


So, we can calculate the number of minutes after midnight the time
indicates, and multiply that with `5.5`&deg;. This may be a number which
is more than `360`&deg; -- each time the minute hand catches up with
the hour hand, the angle with be a multiple of `360`&deg;. So, we will
take the angle module `360`&deg;.

But that may lead to a problem. The number of minutes after midnight
will always be an integer, but once with multiply with `5.5`, we
may not have an integer left. And not every language handles a modulo
operation well if not both operands are integers.

To deal with this, we will measure the angle between the hands in
*half*-degrees. So, will multiply the number of minutes after midnight
with `11`, and then modulo it with `720`. Since we are required to
report the smaller of the angles, if the calculated angle is more than
`360` half-degrees, we subtract the angle from `720`.

What's left is to report the angle in degrees, which means dividing
the calculated number by `2`, so we're back to full degrees.

### Perl

With the input time in `$_`:

~~~~
my $MIN_PER_HOUR    =  60;
my $DIFF_PER_MINUTE =  11;
my $FULL_CIRCLE     = 720;

my ($hours, $minutes) = /[0-9]+/g;
my $angle = ($DIFF_PER_MINUTE * ($hours * $MIN_PER_HOUR + $minutes)) %
             $FULL_CIRCLE;
   $angle =  $FULL_CIRCLE - $angle if 2 * $angle >= $FULL_CIRCLE;

say $angle / 2;
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### AWK

~~~~
BEGIN {
    FS = ":"
    DIFF_PER_MINUTE =  11
    MIN_PER_HOUR    =  60
    FULL_CIRCLE     = 720
}
~~~~

We're setting `FS` here, so AWK will neatly split the input 
for us on colons, meaning we have the hours available in `$1`,
and the minutes in `$2`.

~~~~
{
    angle = (DIFF_PER_MINUTE * ($1 * MIN_PER_HOUR + $2)) % FULL_CIRCLE
    if (2 * angle >= FULL_CIRCLE) {
        angle = FULL_CIRCLE - angle
    }

    print (angle / 2)
}
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Bash

Just like in AWK, Bash can autosplit input for us. We do this
by setting `IFS`:

~~~~
IFS=":"

DIFF_PER_MINUTE=11
MIN_PER_HOUR=60
FULL_CIRCLE=720
~~~~

We can now directly read `hours` and `minutes`. But there is a catch.
Hours and minutes of the form `08` or `09` will be interpreted by
Bash as illegal octal numbers. That's not what we want!

We will use a trick: we prepend the number with a `1` (giving us
a three digit number, starting with a `1`), the subtracting `100`!

~~~~
while read hours minutes
do    ((hours   = "1$hours"   - 100))
      ((minutes = "1$minutes" - 100))
      ((angle = (DIFF_PER_MINUTE * (hours * MIN_PER_HOUR + minutes)) %
                                            FULL_CIRCLE))
      if ((2 * angle >= FULL_CIRCLE))
      then ((angle = FULL_CIRCLE - angle))
      fi
~~~~

Now, Bash only has integer division. So, we first divide `angle` by `2`
and print the result. Then we check whether `angle` is an odd number;
if it is, we print `.5`, as the result should have an additional half degree.

~~~~
      printf "%d" $((angle / 2))
      if ((angle % 2 == 1))
      then printf ".5"
      fi
      echo
done

### bc

The calculations in our bc solution is very similar as the solutions
in other languages, but we need to do something special when printing
the result:

~~~~
diff_per_minute =  11
min_per_hour    =  60
full_circle     = 720

hours   = read ()
minutes = read ()

scale = 0
angle = (diff_per_minute * (hours * min_per_hour + minutes)) % full_circle
if (2 * angle >= full_circle) {
    angle = full_circle - angle
}

scale = angle % 2

if (angle == 1) {
    "0"
}

angle / 2
~~~~

By default, assuming the `-l` isn't used, `bc` uses integer arithmetic.
We can change this by assigning to the special variable `scale`, which
tells bc to how many decimals after the comma you want results.

But setting it to `1` at the beginning of the program and leaving it
at `1` causes two issues: first, it will always print the number of
degrees with one decimal after the decimal dot -- even if the result
is an integer. Furthermore, the modulus operator doesn't work as it
does when `scale` is set to `0`.

So, we first set the scale to `0`, then, before printing the result
set `scale` to `1` iff `angle` is odd. The result is that if the hands
make an angle which is an integer amount of degrees, we print an integer;
otherwise, the result will be an integer and a half.

Another oddity is that bc prints a half as `.5`, not `0.5`. To counteract
that, if `angle` equals `1` (so, one half-degree), we first print a `0`
(which then will be followed by `.5`, giving the end result of `0.5`).

Also note that in bc, all variables are in lowercase.

### C

Nothing special about the C solution. C uses integer division if
both its operands are integers, so a similar check as in our Bash
solution on whether `angle` is odd, and, if so, print `.5`:

~~~~
# define DIFF_PER_MINUTE  11
# define MIN_PER_HOUR     60
# define FULL_CIRCLE     720

int main (void) {
    int hours, minutes;

    while (scanf ("%d:%d", &hours, &minutes) == 2) {
        int angle = (DIFF_PER_MINUTE * (hours * MIN_PER_HOUR + minutes)) %
                                                FULL_CIRCLE;
        if (2 * angle >= FULL_CIRCLE) {
            angle = FULL_CIRCLE - angle;
        }
        printf ("%d", angle / 2);
        if (angle % 2) {
            printf (".5");
        }
        printf ("\n");
    }
    return (0);
}

### Go

In Go, things are similar:

~~~~

    "fmt"
)

var DIFF_PER_MINUTE =  11;
var MIN_PER_HOUR    =  60;
var FULL_CIRCLE     = 720;

func main () {
    var hours, minutes int;
    for {
        var n, err = fmt . Scanf ("%d:%d", &hours, &minutes)
        if (err != nil || n != 2) {
            break;
        }
        var angle = (DIFF_PER_MINUTE * (hours * MIN_PER_HOUR + minutes)) %
                                                FULL_CIRCLE;
        if (2 * angle >= FULL_CIRCLE) {
            angle = FULL_CIRCLE - angle;
        }

        fmt . Print (angle / 2);
        if (angle % 2 == 1) {
            fmt . Print (".5")
        }
        fmt . Print ("\n")

### R

R has a slightly usual assignment operator (`<-`), which came to R from APL.
Indexing arrays requires double brackets. Other than that, the R solution
is very similar to the solutions in other languages:

~~~~
DIFF_PER_MINUTE <-  11
MIN_PER_HOUR    <-  60
FULL_CIRCLE     <- 720

stdin   <- file ('stdin', 'r')
time    <- readLines (stdin, n = 1)
parts   <- strsplit (time, ":")
hours   <- as.numeric (parts [[1]] [[1]])
minutes <- as.numeric (parts [[1]] [[2]])
angle   <- (DIFF_PER_MINUTE * (hours * MIN_PER_HOUR + minutes)) %%
                                       FULL_CIRCLE
if (2 * angle >= FULL_CIRCLE) {
    angle <- FULL_CIRCLE - angle

cat (angle / 2, "\n")

### Ruby

### Tcl

Tcl suffers from the same issue as Bash: if a value starts with a `0`,
tcl treats it as an octal number, which causes a problem for `08`
and `09`. So, we use the same technique we used in Bash: prepend 
a `1` to the number, then subtract `100`:

~~~~
set DIFF_PER_MINUTE   11
set MIN_PER_HOUR      60
set FULL_CIRCLE      720

while {[gets stdin line] >= 0} {
    set parts [split $line :]
    set hours   [expr 1[lindex $parts 0] - 100]
    set minutes [expr 1[lindex $parts 1] - 100]
    set angle   [expr (($DIFF_PER_MINUTE * \
                       ($hours * $MIN_PER_HOUR + $minutes))) % $FULL_CIRCLE]
    if {2 * $angle >= $FULL_CIRCLE} {
        set angle [expr $FULL_CIRCLE - $angle]
    }

    puts -nonewline [expr $angle / 2]
    if {$angle % 2 == 1} {
        puts -nonewline ".5"
    }
    puts ""
