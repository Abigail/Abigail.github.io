# Perl Weekly Challenge 118: Binary Palindrome

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-118/#TASK1)

> You are given a positive integer `$N`.
> 
> Write a script to find out if the binary representation of the given
> integer is Palindrome. Print `1` if it is otherwise `0`.

### Examples

>    Input: $N = 5
>    Output: 1
>
> The binary representation of `5` is `101` which is a palindrome.
>
>    Input: $N = 4
>    Output: 0
>
> The binary representation of `4` is `100` which is **not** a palindrome.

## Solution

We can split this task into two:

* Find the binary representation of the given number.
* Determine whether this is a palindrome.

For most languages, the latter is done by reversing the binary
representation, and see if the result is the same string.

### Perl

For our Perl solution, we use [`sprintf`](#) to get the binary
representation of the number (using the `%b` format). 

We could have use [`reverse`](#) to reverse the string, but then
we would have to store the result of the `sprintf` in a variable.
And then we would need to use two lines. Instead, we use a regular
expression to test if the result of `sprintf` is a palindrome,
so we have a one-liner as a solution:

~~~~
say sprintf ("%b" => $_) =~ /^([01]?|([01])(?1)\g{2})$/ || 0 while <>;
~~~~

To understand the pattern, note that we can define a palindrome
in a recursive way:

!definition
A palindrome is either:

* an empty string, *or*
* a one character string *or*
* a character `c`, followed by a palindrome, followed by `c`.

!/definition

Commented, the pattern looks like:
~~~~
/^          # Start of string
 (          # Start of main group (which matches a palindrome)
   [01]?    # Either an empty string, or a single 0 or 1.
   |        # Or
   ([01])   # Capture a single character using second group  (0 or 1)
   (?1)     # Recurse into the main group (hence, match a palindrome)
   \g{2}    # Match what was matched by the second group
 )          # End of main group
 $/x        # End of string
~~~~

### AWK

First, a function to get the binary representation:

~~~~
function dec2bin (dec, bin) {
    while (dec) {
        bin = dec % 2 bin
        dec = int (dec / 2)
    }
    return (bin)
}
~~~~

AWK doesn't have a build in way to reverse a string, so we're
just going to compare individual characters:

~~~~
{
    bin = dec2bin($1)
    l   = length (bin)
    #
    # Check if it's a palindrome
    #
    for (i = 1; i < l / 2; i ++) {
        if (substr (bin, i, 1) != substr (bin, l - i + 1, 1)) {
            print (0)
            next
        }
    }
    print (1)
}
~~~~

### Bash

Our Bash solution looks a lot like the AWK solution. First, a function
to get the binary representation:

~~~~
function dec2bin () {
    dec=$1
    bin=""
    while ((dec > 0))
    do    bin=$((dec % 2))$bin
          ((dec /= 2))
    done
}
~~~~
It puts the result in the global variable `bin`.

No build in method to reverse a string, so we compare characters again:

~~~~
while read dec
do    dec2bin $dec
      for ((i = 0; i < ${#bin} / 2; i ++))
      do  if   [ "${bin:$i:1}" = "${bin:$((${#bin} - i - 1)):1}" ]
          then continue
          fi
          echo 0
          continue 2
      done
      echo 1
done

### C

In C, we will not get a binary representation. Instead, we compare
bits directly. First, we read the input, and find the highest power
of two equal or less than the given number. This corresponds to the
the first `1` in its binary representation:

~~~~
long long dec;
while (scanf ("%lld", &dec) == 1) {
    long long i = 1;
    int k = 0;
    for (k = 0; i <= dec; k ++, i = i << 1);
    /*
     * We overshot by 1
     */
    k -= 1;
~~~~
So, now we have: \(2^k \leq \text{dec} < 2^{k+1}\).

We now know that the number has \(k + 1\) bits. We now check for each pair
\(0 \leq i < j \leq k, i + j = k\) if bits \(i\) and \(j\) are either
both set, or both unset in the given number. If this is true for all
such pairs, the binary representation is a number:
~~~~
int is_palin = 1;
for (int j = 0; j < k; k --, j ++) {
    if (((dec & (1 << j)) >> j) != ((dec & (1 << k)) >> k)) {
        is_palin = 0;
        break;
    }
}
printf ("%d\n", is_palin);
~~~~

### Go

For Go, we start off with a helper function which returns the 
reverse of a string:

~~~~
func reverse (str string) string {
    rev := [] rune (str)
    for i, j := 0, len (rev) - 1; i < j; i, j = i + 1, j - 1 {
        rev [i], rev [j] = rev [j], rev [i]
    }
    return string (rev)
}
~~~~

To get the binary representation of an integer, we make use of
the `FormatInt` method in the `strconv` package. Which leads
to the following main program:
~~~~
func main () {
    var dec int64
    for {
        var n, err = fmt . Scanf ("%d", &dec)
        if (n != 1 || err != nil) {
            break
        }
        var bin = strconv . FormatInt (dec, 2)
        if (bin == reverse (bin)) {
            fmt . Println (1)
        } else {
            fmt . Println (0)
        }
    }
}
~~~~

### Java

Java has the `toBinaryString` method in the `Integer` class, which we
use to get the binary representation of the number. The
`StringBuilder` class has a `reverse` method. 

So we get:
~~~~
public class ch1 {
    public static void main (String [] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner (System . in);
        try {
            while (true) {
                int    dec = scanner . nextInt ();
                String bin = Integer . toBinaryString (dec);
    
                if (bin . equals (new StringBuilder (bin) .
                                  reverse () . toString ())) {
                    System . out . println (1);
                }
                else {
                    System . out . println (0);
                }
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            //   
            // EOF
            //
        }
    }
}

### Lua

To get the binary representation of a number:
~~~~
function dec2bin (dec)
    local bin = {}
    while dec > 0 do 
        bin [#bin + 1] = dec % 2
        dec = math . floor (dec / 2)
    end
    return table . concat (bin)
end
~~~~
It collects the bits into a table, which at the end it concats
into a single string.

To check for a palindrome, we reverse the string and compare:
~~~~
for line in io . lines () do
    bin = dec2bin (tonumber (line))
    if bin == string . reverse (bin) then
        print (1)
    else
        print (0)
    end
end
~~~~

### Node.js

In Node.js, it's easy to get the binary representation of a number:
`toString (2)`. Node.js does not have a `reverse` acting on a string,
but it does have a `reverse` acting on an array. So, to reverse a string,
we split it into an array of characters, reverse the array, then join
it back together.

This leads to the following lines (at this point, the read in number
is in the string variable `line`):
~~~~
let bin = (+line) . toString (2)
console . log (bin == bin . split ("") . reverse () . join ("") ? 1 : 0)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Python
To get a binary representation, we use `format`, using `{:b}`
as the format string (`line` is our input):
~~~~
bin = '{:b}' . format (int (line))
~~~~
Reversing a string is done by taking a slice of the string, getting
all the characters but stepping one-by-one from the end:
~~~~
if bin == bin [::-1]:
    print (1)
else:
    print (0)
~~~~

### Ruby

Ruby makes it easy to get a binary representation (`dec` is our input):
~~~~
bin = "%b" % dec
~~~~
Its `reverse` method acts on strings:
~~~~
puts (bin == bin . reverse ? 1 : 0)
~~~~
