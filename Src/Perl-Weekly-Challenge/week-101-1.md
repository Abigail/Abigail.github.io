# Perl Weekly Challenge 101: Pack a Spiral

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-101/#TASK1)

> You are given an array `@A` of items (integers say, but they can be anything).
>
> Your task is to pack that array into an `MxN` matrix spirally
> counterclockwise, as tightly as possible.
>
> 'Tightly' means the absolute value `|M-N|` of the difference has
> to be as small as possible.</p></div>

### Examples

#### Example 1

>     Input: @A = (1,2,3,4)
>     
>     Output:
>     
>         4 3
>         1 2
> 
> Since the given array is already a 1x4 matrix on its own, but that's
> not as tight as possible. Instead, you'd spiral it counterclockwise
> into
>     
>         4 3
>         1 2

#### Example 2

>     Input: @A = (1..6)
>     
>     Output:
>     
>         6 5 4
>         1 2 3
>     
>     or
> 
>         5 4
>         6 3
>         1 2
> 
> Either will do as an answer, because they're equally tight.

#### Example 3

>     Input: @A = (1..12)
>     
>     Output:
>     
>         9  8  7 6
>        10 11 12 5
>         1  2  3 4
>     
>     or
> 
>         8  7 6
>         9 12 5
>        10 11 4
>         1  2 3

### Notes
The challenge defines tightly purely based on size of the initial
array -- lengths of the elements do not have to be taken into
account. This is clear from the third example, the first solution
takes an area of 30 characters (3 lines of 10 characters), the
second takes an area of 28 characters (4 lines of 7 characters),
yet both are acceptable.

## Solution
### Overview
The task can be broken down into various parts:

1. Read in the data, and parse it into individual elements.
2. Determine the width and height of the resulting matrix.
3. Fill in the resulting matrix
4. Print the resulting matrix.

#### Read in data
The first sub task is pretty easy. It's not given how we will be
given the array `@A`; therefore, we assume elements are on the first
line of standard input, separated by white space.

#### Determine width and height
To determine the width and height, we have to factor `N`, where `N`
is the number of elements. This typically is a hard problem,
exponential in the number of bits of `N`. But the size of the input
is exponential in the number of bit of `N` anyway -- which means
that if we use a simple try-everything method, we still don't exceed
linear time (in the size of the input).

What we will do is start with \(h = \lfloor
\sqrt{N}\rfloor\) and decrement \(h\) until \(N \mod h = 0\).
At that moment \(h\) will be the height of the resulting matrix,
and \(N / h\) be the width.

#### Fill in the matrix
The fill in the matrix, we use a couple of variables: `min_x`,
`max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, `x`, `y`, and `direction`. The first
four keep track of the minimum/maximum rows and columns of the
matrix with have to filled in. `min_x` and `min_y` will start off
as 0 (or 1 for languages where array indices start at 1). `max_x`
and `max_y` start off as the height and width (minus 1 for languages
where array indices start at 0) of the resulting matrix.

`x` and `y` are the coordinates to be filled in next; we start off
with `x = max_x` and `y = min_y` -- the bottom left of the matrix.
We head off to the right (for which we use `direction` to keep
track). We now fill in the bottom row of the matrix with the first
`W` elements (where `W` is the width of the matrix). Each time we
fill in an element, we increment `y` -- until we hit the corner.
At that moment, our new direction becomes up, and we will now start
decrementing `y` (while keeping `x` constant). And since we have
filled in the bottom row, we decrement `max_x.

We continue this process, filling the matrix one row and column at
a time, turning at each corner, until we have filled in the matrix.

#### Print the matrix
We will first make a pass over the matrix to determine the width
of each column. For each column, we look at each row, and determine
the width of the element on that position. We keep track of the
maximum of those widths for each column.

Given the widths, it's easy to print out the matrix, so each column
is aligned.

### Perl
We start off by setting some constants for directions:

~~~~
my $RIGHT = 0;
my $UP    = 1;
my $LEFT  = 2;
my $DOWN  = 3;
~~~~

Reading data is easy.

~~~~
my @elements = split ' ' => scalar <>;
~~~~

We can now calculate the necessary height and width:

~~~~
my $h = int sqrt @elements;
for (;@elements % $h;) {
    $h --;
}

my $w = @elements / $h;
~~~~

Filling in the matrix, as described above:

~~~~
my $matrix;
my ($min_x, $max_x, $min_y, $max_y) = (0, $h - 1, 0, $w - 1);
my $x = $max_x;
my $y = $min_y;
my $direction = $RIGHT;
foreach my $element (@elements) {
    $$matrix [$x] [$y] = $element;
    my $turn = 0;
    if ($direction == $RIGHT) {
        if   ($y >= $max_y) {$turn = 1; $x --; $max_x --}
        else {$y ++}
    }
    if ($direction == $UP) {
        if   ($x <= $min_x) {$turn = 1; $y --; $max_y --}
        else {$x --}
    }
    if ($direction == $LEFT) {
        if   ($y <= $min_y) {$turn = 1; $x ++; $min_x ++}
        else {$y --}
    }
    if ($direction == $DOWN) {
        if   ($x >= $max_x) {$turn = 1; $y ++; $min_y ++}
        else {$x ++}
    }
    if ($turn) {
        $direction ++;
        $direction %= 4;
    }
}
~~~~

Find out the width of each column:

~~~~
my @widths = map {my $y = $_;
                  max map {length $$matrix [$_] [$y]} 0 .. $h - 1}
                  0 .. $w - 1;
~~~~

Print the matrix:

~~~~
foreach my $row (@$matrix) {
    for (my $y = 0; $y < @$row; $y ++) {
        my $width = $widths [$y];
        printf "%s%${width}s" => $y ? " " : "", $$row [$y];
    }
    print "\n";
}
~~~~

### AWK
The AWK solution is very similar to the Perl solution -- except
that AWK doesn't have support for 2-D arrays. So, we introduce a
method which takes an x and a y coordinate, the width and height
of the matrix, and which then returns a single coordinate.

~~~~
function idx (x, y, h, w) {
    return x * w + y + 1
}
~~~~

The rest is a straight translation of our Perl solution:

~~~~
BEGIN {
    RIGHT = 0
    UP    = 1
    LEFT  = 2
    DOWN  = 3
}   
    
{   
    #
    # Get the data; we're assuming it's one a single line,
    # seperated by white space.  
    #
    split ($0, elements)
         
    #
    # Find optimal sizes: width w and height h
    # We start at the square root, and count downwards till we
    # have a divider.
    #
    n = length (elements)
    h = int (sqrt (n)) 
    for (;n % h;) {
        h --
    }
    w = n / h
         
    #
    # Fill the matrix, starting from the bottom left
    #
    min_x = 0
    max_x = h - 1
    min_y = 0
    max_y = w - 1
    x = max_x
    y = 0
    direction = RIGHT
    for (i = 1; i <= length (elements); i ++) {
        matrix [idx(x, y, h, w)] = elements [i]
        turn = 0
        if (direction == RIGHT) {
            if   (y >= max_y) {turn = 1; x --; max_x --}
            else {y ++}
        }
        if (direction == UP) {
            if   (x <= min_x) {turn = 1; y --; max_y --}
            else {x --}
        }
        if (direction == LEFT) {
            if   (y <= min_y) {turn = 1; x ++; min_x ++}
            else {y --}
        }
        if (direction == DOWN) {  
            if   (x >= max_x) {turn = 1; y ++; min_y ++}

            direction %= 4
        }
    }

    for (y = 0; y < w; y ++) {
        max = 0;
        for (x = 0; x < h; x ++) {
            l = length (matrix [idx(x, y, h, w)])
            if (l > max) {
                max = l
            }
        }
        widths [y + 1] = max
    }

            printf (format, y == 0 ? "" : " ", matrix [idx(x, y, h, w)])
        }
        printf ("\n")
    }

### Bash
Bash does not have 2-D arrays either, so we use an index function
like we did with AWK:

~~~~
function idx () {
    index=$(($1 * $4 + $2))
}
~~~~

Note that in Bash, functions don't return anything, so we use a
global variable, `index` to return the index. Bash function also
don't use parameter names -- instead it uses positional variables
for the input parameter.

Another thing Bash lacks is arithmetic for floating point numbers,
so we lack a `sqrt` method. Instead of counting down, we count up,
and keep track of the largest proper divisor of the size of the
input array:

~~~~
read -a elements
height=1
n=${#elements[*]}
for  ((h = 2; h <= n / h; h ++))
do   if   ((!(n % h)))
     then height=$h
     fi
done
width=$((n / height))
~~~~

Note the use of `(( ))` and `$(( ))`; this is how we do arithmetic in Bash.

We can now fill in the matrix:

~~~~
RIGHT=0
UP=1
LEFT=2
DOWN=3

declare -a matrix
min_x=0
max_x=$((height - 1))
min_y=0
max_y=$((width - 1))  
x=$max_x
y=$min_y
direction=$RIGHT

for ((i = 0; i < n; i ++))
do  idx $x $y $height $width
    matrix[$index]=${elements[$i]}
    turn=0
    if   ((direction == RIGHT))
    then if   ((y >= max_y))
         then turn=1; ((x --)); ((max_x --))
         else ((y ++))
         fi
    fi
    if   ((direction == UP))
    then if   ((x <= min_x))
         then turn=1; ((y --)); ((max_y --))
         else ((x --))
         fi
    fi
    if   ((direction == LEFT))
    then if   ((y <= min_y))
         then turn=1; ((x ++)); ((min_x ++))
         else ((y --))
         fi
    fi
    if   ((direction == DOWN))
    then if   ((x >= max_x))
         then turn=1; ((y ++)); ((min_y ++))
         else ((x ++))
         fi
    fi
    if   ((turn == 1))
    then ((direction ++))
         ((direction %= 4))
    fi
done
~~~~

Finding the columns widths and printing the results:

~~~~
declare -a widths
for  ((y = 0; y < width; y ++))
do   max=0
     for ((x = 0; x < height; x ++))
     do  idx $x $y $height $width
         element=${matrix[$index]}
         if   ((max < ${#element}))
         then max=${#element}
         fi
     done
     widths[$y]=$max
done

for  ((x = 0; x < height; x ++))
do   for  ((y = 0; y < width; y ++))
     do   idx  $x $y $height $width
          if   ((y))
          then printf " "
          fi
          printf %${widths[$y]}s ${matrix[$index]}
     done
     echo
done

C requires more work, as we need to do the memory allocation ourselves. While we can read in our array of data and have it split on whitespace in a single line of code in many languages, we need a lot more code in C:
