# Perl Weekly Challenge 108: Bell Numbers

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-108/#TASK2)

> Write a script to display top 10 Bell Numbers. Please refer to
> [wikipedia page](#wiki:Bell_number) for more informations.

### Example

* \(B_0\): 1 as you can only have one partition of zero element set.
* \(B_1\): 1 as you can only have one partition of one element set \(\\{a\\}\).
* \(B_2\): 2
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\)
* \(B_3\): 5
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b,c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,c\\}\\{b\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b,c\\}\)
* \(B_4\): 15
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\\{c\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\\{c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,c\\}\\{b,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,d\\}\\{b,c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\\{c\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,c\\}\\{b\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,d\\}\\{b\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{b,c\\}\\{a\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{b,d\\}\\{a\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{c,d\\}\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\)
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b,c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{b\\}\\{a,c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{c\\}\\{a,b,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{d\\}\\{a,b,c\\}\)

## Solution
The Bell Numbers have their own entry in the [OEIS](#oeis:A000110).
We can look up the first ten Bell Numbers: \(1\), \(1\), \(2\), \(5\),
\(15\), \(52\), \(203\), \(877\), \(4140\), and \(21147\).

The simplest way would be just to take those ten numbers, and print
them. This turns the exercise yet again into a gloried `Hello, World`
program.

A next step is when our program fetches the numbers from the
[OEIS](https://oeis.org) and print them. For instance, by using
the [`OEIS`](https://metacpan.org/pod/OEIS) module which we recently
uploaded to [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/). Not very useful though -- it's
not that the Bell Numbers will change in the future.
