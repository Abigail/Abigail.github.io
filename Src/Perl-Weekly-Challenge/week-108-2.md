# Perl Weekly Challenge 108: Bell Numbers

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-108/#TASK2)

> Write a script to display top 10 Bell Numbers. Please refer to
> [wikipedia page](#wiki:Bell_number) for more informations.

### Example

* \(B_0\): 1 as you can only have one partition of zero element set.
* \(B_1\): 1 as you can only have one partition of one element set \(\\{a\\}\).
* \(B_2\): 2
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\)
* \(B_3\): 5
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b,c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,c\\}\\{b\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b,c\\}\)
* \(B_4\): 15
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\\{c\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b,c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\\{c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,c\\}\\{b,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,d\\}\\{b,c\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,b\\}\\{c\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,c\\}\\{b\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{a,d\\}\\{b\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{b,c\\}\\{a\\}\\{d\\}\)
    * \(\\{b,d\\}\\{a\\}\\{c\\}\)
    * \(\\{c,d\\}\\{a\\}\\{b\\}\)
    * \(\\{a\\}\\{b,c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{b\\}\\{a,c,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{c\\}\\{a,b,d\\}\)
    * \(\\{d\\}\\{a,b,c\\}\)

## Discussion
The Bell Numbers have their own entry in the [OEIS](#oeis:A000110).
We can look up the first ten Bell Numbers: \(1\), \(1\), \(2\), \(5\),
\(15\), \(52\), \(203\), \(877\), \(4140\), and \(21147\).

### Hello, World!

The simplest way would be just to take those ten numbers, and print
them. This means we have yet again a challenge which is just a glorified
[`Hello, World`](#wiki:"Hello,_World!"_program) program.

### Fetch

If we don't want to do exactly what the challenge asks from us
(print the first ten Bell Numbers), we could instead fetch
the numbers from the [OEIS](https://oeis.org) and print them.
For instance, by using the [`OEIS`](https://metacpan.org/pod/OEIS)
module which we recently uploaded to [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/).

There is limited usefulness in this though -- it's
not that the Bell Numbers will change in the future.

### Calculate

Alternatively, we could calculate the first ten Bell Numbers. There
are many ways to calculate the numbers, but we opt to create a
[*Bell Triangle*](#wiki:Bell_Triangle).

The first rows of the Bell Triangle are as follows:

<pre class = 'bell'>
 1
 1  2
 2  3  5
 5  7 10 15
15 20 27 37 52
</pre>

And we have the following rules to construct the triangle:

* The top row contains a single \(1\).
* For each other row:
    * The row will have one more element than the previous row.
    * The first (left most) element is equal to the last (right most)
      element of the previous row.
    * Each other element is the sum of the element to its left on the same
      row, and the element on the previous row right above that.

Or, formalized:

Let \(b_{r, c}\) be the element on row \(r\) and column \(c\). (This implies
\(0 \leq c \leq r\), with the top most element being \(b_{0, 0}\).)
Then

\[ b_{r, c} = \begin{cases}
      1,                               & \text{if } r = c = 0    \\\\
      b_{r - 1, r - 1},                & \text{if } r > 0, c = 0 \\\\
      b_{r, c - 1} + b_{r - 1, c - 1}, & \text{if } r \geq c > 0
              \end{cases} \]

If we then generate the first nine rows of the Bell Triangle, and take
the last elements of each row, we get the second to tenth Bell Numbers.
The first Bell Number is \(1\).

## Solutions

Depending on the language, we solve the challenge in one or more of the
strategies explained above. All languages will implement the `Hello, World!`
strategy. For some languages, we also calculate the Bell Triangle.
And in Perl, we also implement a fetch strategy.

Languages which solve the problem in more than one way take a command
line argument indicating the strategy to follow. This argument should
be one of `plain` (the default), `fetch` (which fetches the numbers
from the OEIS, or `compute`, which computes the first rows of the Bell 
Triangle.

We will only show the the plain solution for Perl; for the other
implementations, see the GitHub links below.

### Perl
#### plain
Can't be much simpler than this.
~~~~
say "1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147"
~~~~

#### fetch
We're using the new module [`OEIS`](https://metacpan.org/pod/OEIS)
which export a single method, `oeis`, which takes two arguments:
the sequence to fetch, and the number of elements to return.

~~~~
use OEIS;
$, = ", ";
say oeis (110 => 10)
~~~~

#### compute
A straight forward implementation of the algorithm explained above:
~~~~
my @bell = [1];
for (my $x = 1; $x < $COUNT - 1; $x ++) {
$bell [$x] [0] = $bell [$x - 1] [-1];
for (my $y = 1; $y <= $x; $y ++) {
    $bell [$x] [$y] = $bell [$x] [$y - 1] + $bell [$x - 1] [$y - 1]
}

$, = ", ";
say 1, map {$$_ [-1]} @bell;

### AWK
The algorithm above is simply written down in AWK:
~~~~
BEGIN {
    COUNT = 10
    bell [1, 1] = 1
    for (x = 2; x < COUNT; x ++) {
        bell [x, 1] = bell [x - 1, x - 1]
        for (y = 2; y <= x; y ++) {
            bell [x, y] = bell [x, y - 1] + bell [x - 1, y - 1]
        }
    }
    printf "1"
    for (x = 1; x < COUNT; x ++) {
        printf ", %d", bell [x, x]
    }
    printf "\n"
}
~~~~

### Bash
Bash doesn't have two dimensional arrays. So, we're using a function
`index` which takes two arguments (an `x` and a `y` coordinate) and
returns a single index. The return value is written in the global
variable `idx`. We then get:
~~~~
set -f

COUNT=10

function index () {
    local x=$1
    local y=$2
    idx=$((COUNT * x + y))
}

bell[0]=1
for ((x = 1; x < COUNT - 1; x ++))
do   index $x 0;                  i1=$idx
     index $((x - 1)) $((x - 1)); i2=$idx
     bell[$i1]=${bell[$i2]}
     for ((y = 1; y <= x; y ++))
     do  index   $x         $y;       i1=$idx
         index   $x       $((y - 1)); i2=$idx
         index $((x - 1)) $((y - 1)); i3=$idx
         bell[$i1]=$((bell[i2] + bell[i3]))
     done
done

printf "1"
for ((x = 0; x < COUNT - 1; x ++))
do index $x $x;
   printf ", %d" ${bell[$idx]}
done
echo

### C
C requires us to manage our own memory. Other than that, it's the
same algorithm:
~~~~
# define COUNT   10
        
typedef int number;  /* Change if we want large numbers */
char * fmt = "%d";   /* Should match typedef            */

int main (int argc, char * argv []) {
    number ** bell;
    if ((bell = (number **) malloc ((COUNT - 1) * sizeof (number *)))
        == NULL) {
         perror ("Mallocing bell failed");
         exit (1);
    }
    if ((bell [0] = (number *) malloc (sizeof (number))) == NULL) {
        perror ("Mallocing row failed");
        exit (1);
    }
    bell [0] [0] = 1;
    for (int x = 1; x < COUNT - 1; x ++) {
        if ((bell [x] = (number *) malloc ((x + 1) * sizeof (number)))
            == NULL) {
            perror ("Mallocing row failed");
            exit (1);
        }
        bell [x] [0] = bell [x - 1] [x - 1];
        for (int y = 1; y <= x; y ++) {
            bell [x] [y] = bell [x] [y - 1] + bell [x - 1] [y - 1];
        }
    }

    /*
     * Print the right diagonal
     */
    printf (fmt, 1);
    for (int x = 0; x < COUNT - 1; x ++) {
        printf (", ");
        printf (fmt, bell [x] [x]);
    }
    printf ("\n");
    exit (0);

### Lua
Same algorithm:

local bell  = {}

bell [0] = {}
bell [0] [0] = 1
for x = 1, COUNT - 2

    bell [x] [0] = bell [x - 1] [x - 1]
    for  y = 1, x
    do   bell [x] [y] = bell [x] [y - 1] + bell [x - 1] [y - 1]
    end
end

    bell [x] = [bell [x - 1] [x - 1]]   
    let y
    for (y = 1; y <= x; y ++) {
        bell [x] [y] = bell [x] [y - 1] + bell [x - 1] [y - 1]

### Python
Python doesn't autovivify array elements when indexing out of
bounds. So we use the
[`append`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#array.array.append)
method to add elements to arrays.
~~~~
COUNT = 10
bell  = [[1]]
for x in range (1, COUNT - 1):
    bell . append ([bell [x - 1] [x - 1]])
    for y in range (1, x + 1):
        bell [x] . append (bell [x] [y - 1] + bell [x - 1] [y - 1])
        
print (1, end = '')
for x in range (0, COUNT - 1):
    print (",", bell [x] [x], end = '')

print ("")

### Ruby

          bell [x] [y] = bell [x] [y - 1] + bell [x - 1] [y - 1]
