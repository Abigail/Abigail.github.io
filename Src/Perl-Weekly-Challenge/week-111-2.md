# Perl Weekly Challenge 111: Ordered Letters

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-111/#TASK2)

> Given a word, you can sort its letters alphabetically (case insensitive).
> For example, 'beekeeper' becomes 'beeeeekpr' and 'dictionary' becomes
> 'acdiinorty'.
> Write a script to find the longest English words that don't change when
> their letters are sorted.

## Discussion

The English language isn't well defined. There's no authority which
dedices which words belong to the English language, and which don't.
We therefore resort to a word list, which we assume to be on standard
input (one word per line).

This has a pro and a con. The pro is that our solutions are language
agnostic -- feed it words from a different language, and it finds
the longest word with the given constraint (of course, the language needs
to be written using ASCII letters).

The con is that the answer depends on the given word list. And even
for some word lists, the answer may not be unique: there can be multiple
words with the same length.

For instance, the public domain
[ENABLE](https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/enable/download/enable.txt)
word list has two words with seven letters where the letters are in
alphabetical order: *beefily* and *billowy*, and no longer words.

The file `/usr/share/dict/words` on my OS six such words. In addition
to the two words from the ENABLE list, it also has *Adelops*, *alloquy*,
*begorry*, and *egilops*.

The [wordlist originally compiled by
infochimps.com](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/dwyl/english-words)
has an eight letter word: *aegilops*.

## Solution
We will only consider words containing ASCII letters; any word containing
anything else, hyphens, digits, accented letters, we will ignore.

We will consider the input words to be caseless. That is, 'a' sorts
before 'B', which sorts before 'c'.

Three different approaches spring to mind.

1. Split the word into letters, sort the letters, join the letters back
   into a word, and check whether the word is unmodified.
2. Iterate over the characters of a word, and check we don't have any
   two consecutive letters where the second letter comes before the
   first in the alphabet.
3. Use a regular expression:
   `/^a*b*c*d*e*f*g*h*i*j*k*l*m*n*o*p*q*r*s*t*u*v*w*x*y*z*$/i` matches
   any word where the letters are in alphabetical order.

For our solutions below, if the language supports regular expressions,
we use the third option. Else, we use the second option.

### Perl
~~~~
my $pat = join "" => map {"$_*"} 'a' .. 'z';

my $longest = "";

while (<>) {
    $longest = $_ if /^$pat$/i && length ($_) > length ($longest)
}
 
print $longest; 
~~~~
There's not much to it. Of all the input words matching the pattern
(so its letters are in sorted order), remember the longest.

### GNU AWK
GNU AWK support `IGNORECASE`, to do case insensitive matching.
First, we create a pattern, by iterating over the ASCII values:
~~~~
BEGIN {
    IGNORECASE = 1
    longest = ""  
    #
    # Create a pattern /^a*b*...z*$/
    #
    pat = "^"
    for (i = 97; i <= 122; i ++) {
        pat = pat sprintf ("%c*", i)
    }
    pat = pat "$"
}
~~~~
We can then use the pattern to remember the longest word:
~~~~
match ($0, pat) && length ($0) > length (longest) {
    longest = $0
}
~~~~
In an `END` block, we print the longest word:
~~~~
END {
    print longest
}
~~~~

### Bash

In Bash, sub patterns can have quantifiers, but the syntax uses a prefix
notation instead of a postfix. And it needs to be enabled with `shopt`:
~~~~
shopt -s extglob  
     
pat1="*(a)*(b)*(c)*(d)*(e)*(f)*(g)*(h)*(i)*(j)*(k)*(l)*(m)"
pat2="*(n)*(o)*(p)*(q)*(r)*(s)*(t)*(u)*(v)*(w)*(x)*(y)*(z)"
~~~~

Bash doesn't have pattern matching -- but it does have substitution of
a pattern. So, we apply the pattern to the word, replace what was matched
by an empty string, and then check whether we're left with an empty
string. Those are the matching words.

Note also the unique way of lowercasing a string: `${word,,}`.
~~~~
while read line
do    lower=${line,,}                 # Lower case input
      left=${lower/#$pat1$pat2/}      # Remove pattern
                                      # Test whether nothing left,
                                      # and string larger longest found
      if   [ "X$left" == "X" -a ${#line} -gt ${#longest} ]
      then longest=$line
      fi
done

### C
No regular expressions in C. Instead, we iterate over the read
string, and check whether all its characters are in alphabetical order:
~~~~
char *  line         = NULL;
size_t  len          =    0;

while (getline (&line, &len, stdin) != -1) {
    size_t i      = 0;
    bool in_order = 1;
    while (line [i] != '\n') {
        if ((i && tolower (line [i]) < tolower (line [i - 1])) ||
            !isalpha (line [i])) {
            in_order = false;
            break;
        }
        i ++;
    }
~~~~
Of the words in alphabetical order, we have to remember the longest:
~~~~
char *  longest      = NULL;
size_t  longest_size =    0;

if (in_order && i > longest_size) {
    longest_size = i;
    if ((longest = (char *) realloc (longest, (i + 1) * sizeof (char)))
         == NULL) {
        perror ("Realloc failed");
        exit (1);
    }
    for (size_t j = 0; j <= i; j ++) {  /* Copies the newline as well */
        longest [j] = line [j];
    }
    longest [i + 1] = '\0';
}

### Lua
A short Lua program, using a regular expression. Lua doesn't have case
insensitive matching, so we match against a lower case copy of the input:
~~~~
local longest = ""
         
for line in io . lines () do
    if   line : lower ()
              : find  ("^a*b*c*d*e*f*g*i*j*k*l*m*n*o*p*q*r*s*t*u*v*w*x*y*z*$")
         and line : len () > longest : len ()
    then longest = line
    end
end
            
print (longest)
~~~~

### Node.js
Node.js supports regular expressions, leading to:
~~~~
let longest = ""  
         
require ('readline')
. createInterface ({input: process . stdin})
. on ('line', _ => {
    if (_ . match (/^a*b*c*d*e*f*g*i*j*k*l*m*n*o*p*q*r*s*t*u*v*w*x*y*z*$/i) &&
        _ . length > longest . length) {
        longest = _
    }
})
. on ('close', _ => {  
    console . log (longest)
})

### Pascal
Pascal doesn't have regular expressions, so we iterate over the characters,
comparing each character with the previous one.
~~~~
uses sysutils;    
         
var
    line, longest: string;
    ch, prev_ch:   char;
    valid:         boolean;
        
begin
    longest := '';
    while not eof () do
    begin
        readln (line);
        valid   := true;
        prev_ch := ' ';   (* Any char less than 'a' will do *)
 
        for ch in lowercase (line) do
        begin
            if (ch < 'a') or (ch > 'z') or (ch < prev_ch) then
            begin
                valid := false;
                break;
            end;
            prev_ch := ch;
        end;
        if valid and (length (line) > length (longest)) then
        begin
            longest := line;
        end;
    end;
    writeln (longest);
end.

### Python
First, we create a pattern:
~~~~
pat = "^"
for x in list (string . ascii_lowercase):
    pat = pat + x + "*"
pat += "$"
~~~~
Then we match, and remember the longest:
~~~~
longest = ""
for line in fileinput . input ():
    line = line . strip ()
    if re . match (pat, line . lower ()) and len (line) > len (longest):
        longest = line
                
print (longest)

### Ruby
Creating the pattern:
~~~~
pat = "^"
("a" .. "z") . each do
    |letter|
    pat += letter + "*"
end
pat += "$"

Matching:
~~~~
longest = ""
ARGF . each_line do   
    |line|
    if line . downcase =~ /#{pat}/ && line . length > longest . length
        longest = line
    end
end
        
puts (longest)
