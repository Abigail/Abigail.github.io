f(20)=[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26, 30, 32, 35, 41, 44]

## Discussion

This is sequence [A028840](#oeis) in
[The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org).

## Solution

We need to do two things: given a number, find the sum of its digits,
and given a number, check whether that number if a Fibonacci number.

The first taks is similar to what was needed in [week 133](week-133-2.html),
so we can reuse the code.

### Perl

First, we create a method which, given a (non-negative) integer, 
returns the sum of its digit. We do this by getting the digits
one at a time, from the right, using modulus and integer division:

~~~~
sub digitsum ($number) {
    my $sum  =  0;
    my $base = 10;
    while ($number > 0) {
        use integer;
        $sum    += $number % $base;
        $number /= $base;
    }
    return $sum;
}
~~~~

To check whether a number is a Fibonacci number, we keep a hash which
contains Fibonacci numbers. If we have a number `N` of which we want
to know whether it's a Fibonacci number, we first check what the largest
number in our hash is. If it's less than `N`, we generate successive
numbers until we reach or exceed `N`. Then we do a simple look up.

~~~~
sub is_fib ($n) {
    state  $fib = {0 => 1, 1 => 1};
    state  $fib_prev = 0; 
    state  $fib_last = 1; 
    while ($fib_last < $n) {
        ($fib_prev, $fib_last) = ($fib_last, $fib_prev + $fib_last);   
        $$fib {$fib_last}      = 1;
    }
    $$fib {$n}
}
~~~~

We can then print the numbers in a simple loop:

~~~~
while (<>) {
    for (my ($k, $N) = (0, 0 + $_); $N > 0; $k ++) {
        $N --, print "$k " if is_fib digitsum $k
    }
    print "\n";
}
~~~~

### Bc

bc doesn't have hashes. So, we keep the generated Fibonacci numbers
in an array. Once we have generated enough, we will do a binary
search to see whether the input number is a Fibonacci or not.


~~~~
fib_prev  = 1       
fib_last  = 1       
fib [0]   = 0
fib [1]   = 1
fib_count = 2

define is_fib (n) {
    auto t, min, max
    while (fib_last < n) {
        t        = fib_last
        fib_last = fib_prev + fib_last
        fib_prev = t
        fib [fib_count] = fib_last
        fib_count = fib_count + 1
    }
    min = 0
    max = fib_count
    while (min < max) {
        mid = (min + max) / 2
        if (fib [mid] == n) {
            return (1)
        }
        if (fib [mid] < n) {
            min = mid + 1
        } else {
            max = mid
        }
    }
    return (0)
}

### Scheme

For our Scheme solution, we use a recursive solution to calculate
the sum of the digits of a number:

~~~~
(define (digit_sum n)
    (define base 10)
    (if (= n 0) 0 (+ (modulo n base) (digit_sum (floor/ n base)))))
~~~~

To check if a number is a Fibonacci number, this time, we're not
storing numbers generated so far. We use pure recursion:

~~~~
(define (_is_fib n prev last)
    (cond ((= n prev) #t)
          ((< n prev) #f)
          (else (_is_fib n last (+ last prev)))))
 
(define (is_fib n) (_is_fib n 0 1))
~~~~

Since recursion is the name of the game in Scheme, we use recursion
for the loop which prints out the numbers:


~~~~
(define (digit_fib k n)
    (cond ((= n 0) #f)
          ((is_fib (digit_sum k))
             (begin (format #t "~d " k) (digit_fib (+ k 1) (- n 1))))
          (else (digit_fib (+ k 1) n))))
~~~~

Here, `k` is the first number to check, and `n` is the amount of
numbers we still want to check. The main program (also recursive)
looks like this:

~~~~
(define (main)
    (define n (read-line))
    (define k 0)
    (if (not (eof-object? n))
        (begin
            (digit_fib 0 (string->number n))
            (newline)
            (main))))
