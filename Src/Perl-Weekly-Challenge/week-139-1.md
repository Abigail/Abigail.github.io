# Perl Weekly Challenge 139: JortSort

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
You are given a list of numbers.

Write a script to implement JortSort. It should return true/false depending if the given list of numbers are already sorted.
<<<<

### Example 1

~~~~
Input: @n = (1,2,3,4,5)
Output: 1

Since the array is sorted, it prints 1.
~~~~

### Example 2

~~~~
Input: @n = (1,3,2,4,5)
Output: 0

Since the array is NOT sorted, it prints 0.

## Discussion

[JortSort](https://jort.technology/) is a joke.

The original jortSort actually sorts input, then compares the
sorted input with the original input.

It's not clear whether sorting is necessary for a jortSort, or
whether any function which returns whether its input is sorted
or not qualifies as a jortSort.
The challenge is silent on this subject. So, we won't bother
with sorting, and just check whether the input is sorted or not.

## Solution

A list \(L\) is sorted, if and only if, there isn't an index 
\(i > 0\) such that \(L [i - i] > L [i]\).

And that translates to a very simple piece of code.

### AWK

~~~~
{
    sorted = 1
    for (i = 2; i <= NF; i ++) {
        if ($(i - 1) > $i) {
            sorted = 0
        }
    }
    print sorted
}
~~~~

AWK already splits the input for us, putting the values into
`$1`, `$2`, etc.

### Bash

After reading the input into an array `list`, we'll do:

~~~~
((sorted = 1))
for ((i = 1; i < ${#list[@]}; i ++))
do  if ((${list[$i - 1]} > ${list[$i]}))
    then ((sorted = 0))
    fi
done
echo $sorted
~~~~

### bc

In our bc solution, we assume the input is terminated by a `0`.

~~~~
prev = read()
sorted = 1;
while (1) {
    next = read()
    if (next == 0) { # End of input
        sorted
        break 
    }
    if (prev > next) {
        sorted = 0
    }
    prev = next
}
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### C

Here, we pick up the code after we have read a line of input into
the variable `line`, of type `char *`.

~~~~
int offset = 0;
int off;
int prev, next;   
bool sorted = true;
if (sscanf (line, "%d%n", &prev, &offset) != 1) {
    perror ("Failure to scan");
    exit (1);
}
while (sscanf (line + offset, "%d%n", &next, &off) == 1) {
    offset += off;
    if (prev > next) {
        sorted = false;
    }
    prev = next;
}
printf ("%d\n", sorted ? 1 : 0);
~~~~

We use [`sscanf`] to extract integers from the line of input, comparing
each integer (except the first) with the previous one. 

FULL_PROGRAM

### Go

Here, we have read in the data into a string `line`:

~~~~
list   := strings . Split (line, " ")
    
sorted := true
for i := 1; sorted && i < len (list); i ++ {
    prev, _ := strconv . Atoi (list [i - 1])
    next, _ := strconv . Atoi (list [i])
    sorted = prev <= next
}

if (sorted) {
    fmt . Println (1)
} else {
    fmt . Println (0)
}
~~~~

We're using [`Atoi`](https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#Atoi) to map a
string into an integer, as Go doesn't automatically convert
strings into integer.

It's a pity Go lacks a ternary operator.

FULL_PROGRAM

### Java

With `line` a string containing the input, we get a solution very
similar to the Go solution:

~~~~
String [] list = line . split (" ");
boolean sorted = true;
for (int i = 1; sorted && i < list . length; i ++) { 
    sorted = Integer . parseInt (list [i - 1]) <= 
             Integer . parseInt (list [i]); 
}
System . out . println (sorted ? 1 : 0);
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Lua

Lua lacks a `split` function, nor does it have something like
`scanf`. So, we're using pattern matching to extract numbers
from the input line `line`:

~~~~
local sorted = 1
local prev   = nil
for next in line : gmatch ("[0-9]+") do
    if prev ~= nil and prev > next then
        sorted = 0
    end
    prev = next
end
print (sorted)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Node.js

Our Node.js solution also uses pattern matching to extract the
numbers from the line of input, and uses [`reduce`](#) to loop
over the array of numbers, checking if all elements are in order:

~~~~
console . log (line . match (/[0-9]+/gi) . reduce ((sorted, _, i, list) => {
    if (i > 0 && list [i - 1] > list [i]) {sorted = 0}
    return sorted},
    1) 
)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Pascal

In Pascal, we can read in the numbers one by one, allowing us to 
easily compare consecutive numbers:

~~~~
var
    prev, next: integer;
    sorted: integer;

begin
    sorted := 1;
    read (prev);
    while not eoln do begin
        read (next);
        if prev > next then begin
            sorted := 0;
        end;
        prev := next;
    end;
    readln ();
    writeln (sorted);
end.
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Perl

In Perl, we also use pattern matching to extract the numbers from
the input, which is in `$_`. Unlike most other solutions, we don't
require an additional `sorted` variable. Instead, we use [`grep`](#)
to find out whether any pairs of numbers are in unsorted order:

~~~~
my @list = /[0-9]+/g;
say grep ({$list [$_ - 1] > $list [$_]} 1 .. $#list) ? 0 : 1
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Python

In Python, we just split the input, and loop over the resulting list:

~~~~
list = line . split (" ")
sorted = 1
for i in range (1, len (list)):
    if list [i - 1] > list [i]:
        sorted = 0
print (sorted)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### R

In R, we can use `strsplit` to split the input, and `as.numeric`
to map strings to numbers. Then it's our familiar loop:

~~~~
parts  <- strsplit (line, " ")
list   <- as.numeric (parts [[1]])
sorted <- 1
if (length (list) > 1) {
    for (i in 2 : length (list)) {
        if (list [i - 1] > list [i]) {
            sorted <- 0
        }
    }
}       
cat (sorted, "\n")
~~~~

Note we do need a seperate check for the length of the list. If we have
a one element list, the loop `for (i in 2 : length (list)) { .. }` would
be executed twice: first with `i = 2`, then with `i = 1`. Which would
not be what we want.

FULL_PROGRAM

### Ruby

Our Ruby solution is similar to other solutions. We use
[`map`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/Array.html#method-i-map)`.with_index`
to iterate over the list. We're only
interested in the index, so we use `_` to signal we're not
interested in the element.

~~~~
sorted = 1
list = line . strip() . split(" ")
list . map . with_index do
    | _, i |
    if i > 0 && list [i - 1] > list [i] then
        sorted = 0
    end
end
puts (sorted)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Scheme

Our Scheme solution looks very different. Iterating over lists isn't
very Scheme-like. Instead, we use a recursive method:

* A list with less than two elements is sorted.
* Else, if the first element is larger than the second, the list is
  not sorted.
* Else, the list is sorted if the list following the first element is
  sorted.

This leads the following function:

~~~~
(define (is-sorted list)
    (cond ((< (length list) 2)                     1)
          ((> (list-ref list 0) (list-ref list 1)) 0)
          (else (is-sorted (cdr list))))
)
~~~~

After having read the input into a line `line`, we call the function
above as:

~~~~
(display (is-sorted (map-in-order string->number (string-split line #\ ))))
(newline)
~~~~

`string-split` splits the input line on spaces (`\# `). We map the resulting
strings to numbers by applying `string-number` on each element (due to
`map-in-order`). The resulting list of numbers is then passed to
`is-sorted`, and its return value is printed.

### Tcl

Our Tcl solution looks like many other solutions:

~~~~
set list [split $line " "]
set result 1
for {set i 1} {$i < [llength $list]} {incr i} {
    if {[lindex $list [expr $i - 1]] > [lindex $list $i]} {
        set result 0
        break
    }
}
puts $result
~~~~
