# Perl Weekly Challenge 101: Origin-containing Triangle

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-101/#TASK2)

> You are given three points in the plane, as a list of six
> co-ordinates: `A = (x1, y1)`, `B = (x2, y2)` and `C = (x3, y3)`.
> 
> Write a script to find out if the triangle formed by the given
> three co-ordinates contain origin `(0, 0)`.
> 
> Print `1` if found otherwise `0`.

### Example 1

>     Input: A = (0, 1), B = (1, 0) and C = (2, 2)
>     Output: 0

Because that triangle does not contain `(0, 0)`.

### Example 2

>     Input: A = (1, 1), B = (-1, 1) and C = (0, -3)
>     Output: 0

Because that triangle contain `(0, 0)` in its interior.

### Example 1

>     Input: A = (0, 1), B = (2, 0) and C = (-6, 2)
>     Output: 0

Because `(0, 0)` is on the edge connecting B and C.

## Solution
To determine whether a point lies inside a triangle, look at the
lines connecting subsequent points; that is, look at the line through
`A` and `B`, the line through `B` and `C`, and the line through `C`
and `A`. (Direction is important here). A point lies inside the
triangle if it lies to the *same side* of each of those lines --
that is, either to the left, or the the right of each of those
lines. If we consider a point to be inside the triangle if it lies
on the line, then it becomes either left or on each of the lines,
or right or on each of the lines.

There is a simple formula to determine whether a point lies to the
right, the left, or on a line given two points on that line. [This
stackoverflow
question](https://programmingblog702692439.wordpress.com/?p=1744&preview=true)
has an example (by [Kornel
Kisielewicz](https://stackoverflow.com/users/233522/kornel-kisielewicz)):

~~~~
float sign (fPoint p1, fPoint p2, fPoint p3) {
    return (p1.x - p3.x) * (p2.y - p3.y) - (p2.x - p3.x) * (p1.y - p3.y);
}
~~~~

This function returns a negative number if point `p1` lies to the
left on the line through `p2` and `p3`, and a positive number if
`p1` lies to the right of that line. If it lies on the line, `0`
is returned.

Since we're interested in the origin, we can simplify this to:

~~~~
sub side ($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2) {
    ($y2 - $y1) * $x2 - ($x2 - $x1) * $y2;
}
~~~~
Note that we now are passing in the coordinates separately, instead
of a structure.

If we have the results of calling this function with each pair of
points, all we need to check whether all results are either
non-negative or non-positive. If this is the case, the origin lies
in the triangle -- otherwise, it does not.

We will be assuming we get the coordinates of the triangles on
standard input -- each triangle on a separate line. Each line
consists of six numbers, separated by white space.

### Perl
~~~~
while (<>) {
    my ($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, $x3, $y3) = split;

    my $s1 = side ($x2, $y2, $x3, $y3);
    my $s2 = side ($x3, $y3, $x1, $y1);
    my $s3 = side ($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2);

    say $s1 <= 0 && $s2 <= 0 && $s3 <= 0 ||
        $s1 >= 0 && $s2 >= 0 && $s3 >= 0 ? 1 : 0
}
~~~~

We're using the `side` function we've shown above. Once we have
three results, we check whether they are all less then or equal to
`0`, or all greater than or equal to `0`; if so, we print `1`, else
we print `0`.

### AWK
The AWK solution is very similar to the Perl solution above. AWK
automatically iterates over the input, and splits the input on white
space, giving the fields as positional parameters (`$1`, `$2`, etc).
This leads to the following program:

~~~~
function side (x1, y1, x2, y2) {
    return (y2 - y1) * x2 - (x2 - x1) * y2
}

{   
    # x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
    # $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6
    s1 = side($3, $4, $5, $6)
    s2 = side($5, $6, $1, $2)
    s3 = side($1, $2, $3, $4)

    print (s1 <= 0 && s2 <= 0 && s3 <= 0 ||
           s1 >= 0 && s2 >= 0 && s3 >= 0 ? 1 : 0)
}
~~~~

### Bash
We can use the same algorithm in Bash. Bash does have its idiosyncrasies:
functions don't have (useful) return values, and functions use
positional parameters to handle input parameters. Arithmetic is
done with `(( ))` and `$(( ))`.

~~~~
function calc_side () {
    #
    # $1: x1; $2: y1; $3 = x2; $4 = y2
    #
    side=$((($4 - $2) * $3 - ($3 - $1) * $4))
}   
    
while read x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3
do    calc_side x2 y2 x3 y3; s1=$side
      calc_side x3 y3 x1 y1; s2=$side
      calc_side x1 y1 x2 y2; s3=$side
    
      echo $(( $s1 <= 0 && $s2 <= 0 && $s3 <= 0 ||
               $s1 >= 0 && $s2 >= 0 && $s3 >= 0 ? 1 : 0 ))
done

### Befunge-93
We will use the same algorithm in Befunge-93. However, the program
looks very differently. Unlike the solutions in the other languages,
we only accept one line of input.

~~~~

         >          >          >               "0" ^
~~~~

Befunge-93 does not have variables. It does have a stack, but we
can only access the top two elements of the stack. We can, however,
write values into the program itself.

The second line of the program is blank -- and this is were we write
values to. Six positions, (`(1, 1)` to `(1, 6)`) to are reserved
for the input, and then three positions (`(1, 7)` to `(1, 9)`) for
the results of where the origin lies relative to a line.

We start off by reading six numbers, and storing them:

~~~~
&11p  &21p  &31p  &41p  &51p  &61p
~~~~

here, `ï¹ ` reads a number and pushes it on the stack; `11` pushes
two `1`s on the stack, while `p` pops three values from the stack:
the first two indicate the location where the third value is stored.
So this line reads six numbers, which are stored on the second line
of the program.

We then do the sign calculation. We don't have functions in Befunge-93,
so we will repeat the code to do the calculations. We'll fetch the
values using the `g` operator, which pops two coordinates from the
stack, then pushes the value on found on that location on the stack.
The results are stored on the locations `(1, 7)` to `(1, 9)`.

~~~~
 61g 41g - 51g * 51g 31g - 61g * - 71p     v>
 21g 61g - 11g * 11g 51g - 21g * - 81p    v>
 41g 21g - 31g * 31g 11g - 41g * - 91p   v>
~~~~

Note that in Befunge-93 the program lies on the torus, so if we go
to the left, we wrap around returning from the right.

We now check the results, if they are all less then or equal to
`0`, or if the are all greater than or equal to `0`, we print `1`;
else we print `0`:

~~~~
  71g0` #v_  81g0` #v_  91g0` #v_ v      >
v        <          <          <  >            "1" v
>071g ` #v_ 081g ` #v_ 091g ` #v_ ^                >, 55+, @
         >          >          >               "0" ^
~~~~

We are printing the characters `0` and `1`, and not the numbers `0`
and `1`. This is because in Befunge-93, if a number is printed, a
space is printed as well. And that would mean the output is different
from the output of the solutions of the other languages.

### C
The algorithm translates easily to C. We're using a typedef to avoid
some typing.

~~~~
typedef long double num;

num side (num x1, num y1, num x2, num y2) {
    return (y2 - y1) * x2 - (x2 - x1) * y2;
}

int main (void) {
    char *  line = NULL;
    size_t  len  = 0;

    while (getline (&line, &len, stdin) != -1) {
        num x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3;
        num s1, s2, s3;

        if (sscanf (line, "%Lf %Lf %Lf %Lf %Lf %Lf",
                           &x1, &y1, &x2, &y2, &x3, &y3) != 6) {
            fprintf (stderr, "Could not parse input\n");
            exit (1);
        }
 
        s1 = side (x2, y2, x3, y3);
        s2 = side (x3, y3, x1, y1);
        s3 = side (x1, y1, x2, y2);

        printf ("%d\n", (s1 <= 0 && s2 <= 0 && s3 <= 0) ||
                        (s1 >= 0 && s2 >= 0 && s3 >= 0) ? 1 : 0);
    }
    free (line);

    return (0);
}

    s2 = side (x3, y3, x1, y1)
    s3 = side (x1, y1, x2, y2)

    if s1 <= 0 and s2 <= 0 and s3 <= 0 or \
