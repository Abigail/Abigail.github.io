# Perl Weekly Challenge 104: FUCS Sequence

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-104/#TASK1)

> Write a script to generate first 50 members of FUSC Sequence.
> Please refer to [OEIS](http://oeis.org/A002487) for more information.
> 
> The sequence defined as below:
>
>     fusc(0) = 0
>     fusc(1) = 1
>     for n > 1:
>     when n is even: fusc(n) = fusc(n / 2),
>     when n is odd: fusc(n) = fusc((n-1)/2) + fusc((n+1)/2)

## Solutions

Remember what the first rule of optimization is? *Don't do anything
which is not needed.* We could write some code which performs the
steps above, and we would certainly do so if the challenged asked
to for the `N`th number in the FUSC sequence, where `N` is given
as input.

But we're not asked to do that. We're asked to generate the first
50 numbers. We don't need to do any calculations; we can just reuse
the work done by the OEIS, and grab [its list of first 92 numbers
of the FUSC sequence](https://oeis.org/A002487/list).

The challenge then reduces to a glorified [Hello,
World!](https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text) program.

### Perl

~~~~
say "0 1 1 2 1 3 2 3 1 4 3 5 2 5 3 4 1 5 4 7 3 8 5 7 2 7 " .
    "5 8 3 7 4 5 1 6 5 9 4 11 7 10 3 11 8 13 5 12 7 9 2 9";
~~~~

There is not much to say. We're just printing the first 50 numbers.

### Other languages
We have solved this in a bunch of different languages as well. We're not going to reproduce the code here, just links to the programs on GitHub:
[AWK](#github), [Bash](#github), [Basic](#github), [Befunge-93](#github),
[bc](#github), [C](#github), [Cobol](#github), [C-shell](#github), 
[Erlang](#github), [Forth](#github), [Fortran](#github), [Go](#github), 
[Java](#github), [Lua](#github), [m4](#github), [Node.js](#github), 
[OCaml](#github), [Pascal](#github), [PHP](#github), [Python](#github), 
[R](#github), [Rexx](#github), [Ruby](#github), [Scheme](#github), 
[sed](#github), [SQL](#github), and [Tcl](#github).

## Alternative solution

We decided to write a solution which does the calculations anyway.
The given definitions transforms easily to code -- but we're using
a cache to avoid repeatedly calculating the same expression.

### Perl

~~~~
my $AMOUNT_OF_NUMBERS_TO_PRODUCE = 50;

sub fusc;
sub fusc ($n) {
    state $cache = {0 => 0, 1 => 1};
    $$cache {$n} //= do {$n % 2 ? fusc (($n - 1) / 2) + fusc (($n + 1) / 2)
                                : fusc  ($n      / 2)}
}

say join " " => map {fusc $_} 0 .. $AMOUNT_OF_NUMBERS_TO_PRODUCE - 1;
~~~~

We have a cache `$cache` which is initialized with the values for
`0` and `1`. (Note that a `state` variable keeps its value even if
the block is entered more than once; the assignment is only done
the first time the block is entered).

Then if the value isn't in the cache yet, we calculate it using
recursion. Finally, we return the wanted value.

We implemented the same algorithm in a bunch of different languages
as well. Again, we're just providing links, as all solutions follow
the same algorithm:
