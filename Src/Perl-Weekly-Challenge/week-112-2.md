# Perl Weekly Challenge 112: Climb Stairs

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-112/#TASK2)

> You are given $n steps to climb
>
> Write a script to find out the distinct ways to climb to the top.
> You are allowed to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

### Example

>     Input: $n = 3
>     Output: 3
>     
>         Option 1: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
>         Option 2: 1 step + 2 steps
>         Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step
>     
>     Input: $n = 4
>     Output: 5
>     
>         Option 1: 1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
>         Option 2: 1 step + 1 step + 2 steps
>         Option 3: 2 steps + 1 step + 1 step
>         Option 4: 1 step + 2 steps + 1 step
>         Option 5: 2 steps + 2 steps

## Discussion

If we can climb stairs one or two steps at a time, then the number
of ways to climb a stair with \(N\) steps is the number of ways
to climb a stair with \(N - 1\) steps (if we first climb one step),
plus the number of ways to climb of stair with \(N - 2\) steps (if
we first climb two steps).

Since there is just one way to climb a stair case with 0 or with 1
step, we have the following formula to climb a stair case with \(N\)
steps:

\[ S (N) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } N = 0 \\\\
                         1 & \text{if } N = 1 \\\\
                         S (N - 1) + S (N - 2) & \text{if } N > 1
           \end{cases} \]

But this means that \(S (N)\) is \(F (N + 1)\), where \(F\) is the
[Fibonacci Sequence](#wiki). And we have a closed formula for this:

\[ F (N) = \frac{\varphi^N - \psi^N}{\sqrt{5}} \]

where

\[ \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \text{ and } \psi = \frac{1}{\varphi} \]

Since \(\psi < 1\), the component \(\psi^N\) goes to \(0\). Hence

\[ F (N) \approx \frac{\varphi^N}{\sqrt{5}} \]

In fact, 

\[ F (N) = \left[ \frac{\varphi^N}{\sqrt{5}} \right] \]

where \([\text{expr}]\) rounds the expression to the nearest integer.

So, if we have a stair case with \(N\) steps, the answer we are looking
for is:

\[ S (N) = \left[ \frac{\varphi^{N + 1}}{\sqrt{5}} \right] \]


## Solutions

For most languages, we use the formula above. In Bash and Befunge-93,
we can only do integer arithmetic, so we use the recursive definition.

In the solutions below, the number of steps the stair case is in a variable
`n` (or `$n`):

### Bash
Here we use a starndard recursive definition of the Fibonacci numbers.
We're using a cache to speed things up:
~~~~
declare -A cache
cache[0]=1
cache[1]=1

function fib () {
    local n=$1
    if   [[ -z ${cache[$n]} ]]
    then fib $((n - 1))
         cache[$n]=$result
         fib $((n - 2))
         cache[$n]=$((cache[$n] + result))
    fi
    result=${cache[$n]}
}
~~~~
Calling `fib` and printing the results:
~~~~
fib  $n
echo $result

### Befunge-93
~~~~
> & :1+!#@_ 111p112p > :!#v_ 12g:11g+12p11p :1- v
                     ^                          <

~~~~

The program above is an iterative formula to calculate the Fibonacci
numbers. We use the cells `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` to store the two
previous numbers in the sequence. These numbers are initialized to 1,
using the following fragment:
~~~~
            111p112p
~~~~
On the stack we keep track how often we still need to iterate. If the
number on the stack is `0`, we break out of the loop:
~~~~
                     > :!#v_                    v
                     ^                          <
                          <
~~~~
Inside the loop, we set the second to last number to the last number,
and the last number to the sum of the last and second to last number.
And then we substract 1 from the number on the stack:
~~~~
                             12g:11g+12p11p :1-
~~~~
When we break out of the loop, we print the result:
~~~~
               ,+55  .g11
~~~~
This line is run left to right, and it fetches the number from
the cell `(1, 1)`, which is printed (`.`), followed by a newline 
(`55+,`).
