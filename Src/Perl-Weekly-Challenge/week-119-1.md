# Perl Weekly Challenge 119: Swap Nibbles

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-119/#TASK1)

> You are given a positive integer `$N`.
> 
> Write a script to swap the two nibbles of the binary representation of
> the given number and print the decimal number of the new binary
> representation.
>
> > A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet.
>
> To keep the task simple, we only allow integer less than or equal to `255`.

### Examples

>     Input: $N = 101
>     Output: 86
>
> Binary representation of decimal `101` is `1100101` or as
> 2 nibbles `(0110)(0101)`. The swapped nibbles would be `(0101)(0110)`
> same as decimal `86`.
>
>     Input: $N = 18
>     Output: 33
>
> Binary representation of decimal `18` is `10010` or as 2 nibbles
> `(0001)(0010)`. The swapped nibbles would be `(0010)(0001)`
> same as decimal `33`.


## Solution

Whether the input integers are less than `255` or not doesn't make
the task much easier. So, we will allow positive integers exceeding `255`.

If we take a number, and look at its binary representation, we get

\[ \ldots b_{10} b_{9} b_{8} b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0 \]

Swapping the last two nibbles, we get:

\[ \ldots b_{10} b_{9} b_{8} b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0 b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 \]

Now, we could take the number, get a binary representation, 
swap the two nibbles using a regular expression or substrings, 
and turn this back into a decimal number.

But we can achieve the same things by manipulating the bits
directly. To do this, we first split the original number,
which will call \(N\), into three parts:

\[ \begin{array}{rccccccccccc|rcrl}
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& & \sim & \text{0xFF}) \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0xF0}) \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0x0F}) \\\\ \hline
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 &
               &    &      &
            \end{array} \]


We can now shift the bits of the latter two parts four positions
to the right or left:

\[ \begin{array}{rccccccccccc|rcrlcc}
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& & \sim & \text{0xFF}) & & \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0xF0}) & >> & 4 \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0x0F}) & << & 4 \\\\ \hline
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 &
               &    &      &
            \end{array} \]


We can now use a bitwise-or (`|`) or just plain addition to of
the three parts above to get the final result.


### Perl
With the input number in `$_`:
~~~~
say + ($_ & ~0xFF) | ($_ & 0x0F) << 4 | ($_ & 0xF0) >> 4
~~~~

### AWK

AWK does not have bitwise operators. But we can replace each of 
bitwise operations with arithmetic. Here, the input number is
in `$1`:

~~~~
print (($1 - ($1 % 256)) + ($1 %  16) * 16 + int (($1 % 256) / 16))
~~~~

### Bash

With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
echo $(((num & ~0xFF) | (num & 0x0F) << 4 | (num & 0xF0) >> 4))
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### bc

bc doesn't have bitwise operators either, so we use arithmetic.
With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
num - (num % 256) + (num % 16) * 16 + (num % 256) / 16
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### C

With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
printf ("%d\n", (num & ~0xFF) | (num & 0x0F) << 4 | (num & 0xF0) >> 4);
~~~~

### Go

Go doesn't have an unary operator to flip all the bits of its
argument (`~`), but it does have a binary operator which does
the same thing: (`&^`). With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
fmt . Printf ("%d\n", (num &^ 0xFF) | (num & 0x0F) << 4 | (num & 0xF0) >> 4)
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Java

With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
System . out . println ((num & ~0xFF) | (num & 0x0F) << 4 | (num & 0xF0) >> 4);
~~~~

### Lua

Lua does not have bitwise operators. So, like AWK, we're using
arithmetic. With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
print (                (num - (num   % 0x100))
       +              ((num % 0x010) * 0x010)
       + math . floor ((num % 0x100) / 0x010))
~~~~

### Node.js

With the input number in `num`:

~~~~
console . log ((+num & ~0xFF) | (+num & 0x0F) << 4 | (+num & 0xF0) >> 4)
~~~~

### Free Pascal

Free Pascal does have the standard bitwise operators, but they are
named differently. It uses `and`, `or` and `not` where most languages
use `&`, `|` and `~`. To shift bits to the left or to the right,
the operators `shl` and `shr` are used. Free Pascal uses a dollar (`$`)
prefix to indicate hexadecimal literals.

Which leads to the following code, with the input number in `num`:

~~~~
writeln ((num and not $FF) or (num and $0F) shl 4 or (num and $F0) shr 4);
