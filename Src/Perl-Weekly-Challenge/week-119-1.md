# Perl Weekly Challenge 119: Swap Nibbles

## [Challenge](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-119/#TASK1)

> You are given a positive integer `$N`.
> 
> Write a script to swap the two nibbles of the binary representation of
> the given number and print the decimal number of the new binary
> representation.
>
> > A nibble is a four-bit aggregation, or half an octet.
>
> To keep the task simple, we only allow integer less than or equal to `255`.

### Examples

>     Input: $N = 101
>     Output: 86
>
> Binary representation of decimal `101` is `1100101` or as
> 2 nibbles `(0110)(0101)`. The swapped nibbles would be `(0101)(0110)`
> same as decimal `86`.
>
>     Input: $N = 18
>     Output: 33
>
> Binary representation of decimal `18` is `10010` or as 2 nibbles
> `(0001)(0010)`. The swapped nibbles would be `(0010)(0001)`
> same as decimal `33`.


## Solution

Whether the input integers are less than `255` or not doesn't make
the task much easier. So, we will allow positive integers exceeding `255`.

If we take a number, and look at its binary representation, we get

\[ \ldots b_{10} b_{9} b_{8} b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0 \]

Swapping the last two nibbles, we get:

\[ \ldots b_{10} b_{9} b_{8} b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0 b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 \]

Now, we could take the number, get a binary representation, 
swap the two nibbles using a regular expression or substrings, 
and turn this back into a decimal number.

But we can achieve the same things by manipulating the bits
directly. To do this, we first split the original number,
which will call \(N\), into three parts:

\[ \begin{array}{rccccccccccc|rcrl}
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& & \sim & \text{0xFF}) \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0xF0}) \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0x0F}) \\\\ \hline
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 &
               &    &      &
            \end{array} \]


We can now shift the bits of the latter two parts four positions
to the right or left:

\[ \begin{array}{rccccccccccc|rcrlcc}
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& & \sim & \text{0xFF}) & & \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0xF0}) & >> & 4 \\\\
 \ldots & 0 & 0 & 0 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 &
            (N & \& &      & \text{0x0F}) & << & 4 \\\\ \hline
 \ldots & b_{10} & b_9 & b_8 & b_3 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & b_7 & b_6 & b_5 & b_4 &
               &    &      &
            \end{array} \]


We can now use a bitwise-or (`|`) or just plain addition to of
the three parts above to get the final result.

### AWK

AWK does not have bitwise operators. But we can replace each of 
bitwise operations with arithmetic. Here, the input number is
in `$1`:

~~~~
print (($1 - ($1 % 256)) + ($1 %  16) * 16 + int (($1 % 256) / 16))
~~~~

### bc

bc doesn't have bitwise operators either, so we use arithmetic.
With the input number in `num`:

### Befunge-93

There are no bitwise operations in Befunge-93, so we have to use
arithmetic. Befunge-93 also limits numerical literals to single
digits. And the language is stack based. This leads to:

~~~~
& :1+!#@_ : 44* % 44** \ 44*/ + . 55+,
~~~~

We start off by reading in a numeric value `&`.

We then check whether we're at end-of-file; in that case, the value read
is `-1`. If so, we want to quit the program. First, we duplicate the value
just read (`:`), add one to it (`1+`), and flip the resulting truth value
(`!`). We skip the next command (`#@`), and then make a decision: if the
top of the stack is false (which it is if we are not at end-of-file), we
continue to the right, else we go left (`_`). If we go left, we exit the
program (`@`).

If we go right, we can calculate the wanted value. First, we duplicate
the top of the stack again (`:`). We then push `4` twice on the stack,
and multiply the them, resulting in having `16` on top of the stack
(`44*`). Now, we mod the (duplicate of) the read in value with the
`16` on the top of the stack (`%`) -- this is the value of the last
nibble. We then multiply this value with `16` (`44**`).

We now have on the top of the stack the last nibble of the input
value, shifted four bits the to left. The next value on the stack
is the input value. We now swap the two values on top of the stack
(`\`), and divide the top of the stack by `16` (`44*/`). Befunge-93
does integer division only, so we have the value of the penultimate
nibble on top of the stack.

Since the second value of the stack is the last nibble shifted by four
bits, we just have to add the two values to get the final result: (`+`),
which we then print (`.`), followed by a newline (`55+,`) (a newline
has ASCII value `10`). 

The program counter now automatically wraps to the beginning again,
as the program is laid out on a torus.

Note that Befunge-93 only handles values up to `255`, so we're not
making any attempt to handle values exceeding `255`.

### Go

Go doesn't have an unary operator to flip all the bits of its
argument (`~`), but it does have a binary operator which does
the same thing: (`&^`). With the input number in `num`:

Lua does not have bitwise operators. So, like AWK, we're using
arithmetic. With the input number in `num`:

       +              ((num % 0x010) * 0x010)

### Free Pascal

Free Pascal does have the standard bitwise operators, but they are
named differently. It uses `and`, `or` and `not` where most languages
use `&`, `|` and `~`. To shift bits to the left or to the right,
the operators `shl` and `shr` are used. Free Pascal uses a dollar (`$`)
prefix to indicate hexadecimal literals.

Which leads to the following code, with the input number in `num`:

~~~~
writeln ((num and not $FF) or (num and $0F) shl 4 or (num and $F0) shr 4);

R does not have bitwise operators, but it does have [bitwise

### Scheme

Scheme does not have bitwise operators, but
[bitwise *functions*][bitw]. Bitwise or and bitwise and are named
`logior` and `logand`, bitwise not is called `lognot`, and shifting
bits is done with `ash` (arithmetic shift). A negative second argument
to `ash` shifts to the right, else it shifts left.

Hexadecimal literals in Scheme are prefixed with `#x`. 

This leads to, with the input number in `num`:

~~~~
(format #t "~d\n" (logior (logand num (lognot #xFF))
                     (ash (logand num #x0F)  4)
                     (ash (logand num #xF0) -4)))
