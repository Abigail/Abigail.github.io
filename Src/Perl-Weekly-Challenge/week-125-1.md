# Perl Weekly Challenge 125: Pythagorean Triples

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
You are given a positive integer `$N`.

Write a script to print all *Pythagorean Triples* containing `$N`
as a member. Print -1 if it can&rsquo;t be a member of any.

Triples with the same set of elements are considered the same, i.e.
if your script has already printed `(3, 4, 5)`, `(4, 3, 5)` should not
be printed.

>>>>
The famous Pythagorean theorem states that in a right angle triangle,
the length of the two shorter sides and the length of the longest side
are related by \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).
<<<<

A Pythagorean triple refers to the triple of three integers whose
lengths can compose a right-angled triangle.

### Example

~~~~
Input: $N = 5
Output: (3, 4, 5)
        (5, 12, 13)

Input: $N = 13
Output: (5, 12, 13)
        (13, 84, 85)

Input: $N = 1
Output: -1

## Solution

We will resort to doing a brute force search. We will consider two
cases: first the case where the given number (\(n\)) isn't the hypotenuse,
followed by the case where \(n\) is the hypotenuse. One or both
cases may result in solutions. (There will be solutions if and only if
\(n\) exceeds 2).

#### Case 1: \(n\) is not the hypotenuse

In this case, \(n\) is one of the shorter sides. W.l.o.g, assume \(n\)
is \(a\). So, we now must find \(b\) and \(c\) such that
\(n^2 + b^2 = c^2\). We do this by trying increasing values of \(c\),
and checking whether \(b = \sqrt{c^2 - n^2}\) is a perfect square.

Since the \(c\) is the larger of the numbers, the minimum value of \(c\)
to consider is \(n + 1\). Note that there are Pythagorian triples where
\(c\) is one more than other sides. \((3, 4, 5)\) and \((5, 12, 13)\)
are two examples.

We can stop our search if \(b > c - 1\). Then
\[
    \begin{array}{lc}
        b = \sqrt{c^2 - n^2} > c - 1 && \implies \\\\
        b^2 = c^2 - n^2 > (c - 1)^2  && \implies \\\\
        c^2 - (c - 1)^2 > n^2        && \implies \\\\
        c^2 - c^2 + 2 \cdot c - 1 = 2 \cdot c - 1 > n^2 &&
    \end{array}
\]

Now, for each \(c\) within those limits, we calculate
\(b^2 = c^2 - n^2\), and
\(b = \lfloor 0.4 + \sqrt{b^2} \rfloor\). Now, \(b^2\) is a perfect
square, if and only if \(b^2 = b \cdot b\). And if \(b^2\) is a perfect
square, then \((n, b, c)\) is a Pythagorian Triple.

#### Case 2: \(n\) is the hypotenuse

Then \(n = c\). W.l.o.g. assume \(a < b\) (they cannot equal). Since 
there are no Pythagorian Triples were one of the sides has length
\(1\) or \(2\), we have \(3 \leq a\). Also, since \(a < b\), we have:

\[
    \begin{array}{lc}
        a^2 + b^2 = n^2  && \implies  \\\\
        2 \cdot b^2 < n^2 && \implies \\\\
        b^2 < \frac{n^2}{2} && \implies \\\\
        a < b < \sqrt{\frac{n^2}{2}} = \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} && \implies \\\\
        a \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} \right\rfloor &&
    \end{array}
\]

So, for each \(3 \leq a \left\lfloor \frac{n}{\sqrt{2}} \right\rfloor\)
we calculate \(b^2 = n^2 - a^2\), and check whether this is a 
perfect square in the same was as above. In such a case, \(a, b, n\)
is a Pythagorian Triple.

### Perl

First a function which calculates 
\(\left\lfloor 0.4 + \sqrt{b^2} \right\rfloor\):

~~~~
sub introot ($square) {
    int (.4 + sqrt ($square));
}
~~~~

Checking whether `$n` can be part of a Pythagorian Triple:
~~~~
say (-1) if $n <= 2;
~~~~

The case where `$n` is not the hypotenuse:

~~~~
my $n_sq = $n * $n;

my $c    = $n + 1;
my $c_sq = $n_sq + 2 * $n + 1;
while (2 * $c - 1 <= $n_sq) {
    my $b_sq = $c_sq - $n_sq;
    my $b    = introot ($b_sq);

    say "$n $b $c" if $b_sq == $b * $b;
    $c_sq += 2 * $c ++ + 1;  # (c + 1)^2 == c^2 + 2 * c + 1
}
~~~~

Note that if \(c = n + 1\), then \(c^2 = (n + 1)^2 = n^2 + 2 \cdot n + 1\).
In the same way, \((c + 1)^2 = c^2 + 2 \cdot c + 1\).

Now, the case where `$n` is the hypotenuse:

~~~~
my $max_a = int ($n / sqrt (2));
for (my $a = 3; $a <= $max_a; $a ++) {
    my $b_sq = $n_sq - $a * $a;
    my $b    = introot ($b_sq);
    say "$a $b $n" if $b_sq == $b * $b;
}
~~~~
