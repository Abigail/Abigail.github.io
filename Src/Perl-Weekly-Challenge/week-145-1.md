# Perl Weekly Challenge 145: Dot Product

## [Challenge][task1]
>>>>
You are given 2 arrays of same size, `@a` and `@b`.

Write a script to implement `Dot Product`.
<<<<

### Example:

~~~~
@a = (1, 2, 3);
@b = (4, 5, 6);

$dot_product = (1 * 4) + (2 * 5) + (3 * 6) =&gt; 4 + 10 + 18 =&gt; 32

## Discussion

There is nothing difficult about this challenge. We just have to pairwise
multiply the coordinates, and sum them, as the [dot product](#wiki) of
two vectors is defined as:

\[
    v_a \bullet v_b = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot b_i, \:\text{where }
    v_a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \:\text{and } v_b = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)
\]

## Solution

We will be assuming we have two lines of input, each line having the
coordinates of one vector. The coordinates will be separated by a space,
and we will assume both vectors have the same number of coordinates.

For some languages, we will assume the coordinates are integers.

### Perl

[`Math::Matrix`](#) has many useful operations on matrices (and vectors
are just one-dimensional matrices), including
[`dotproduct`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Matrix#dot_product()), which, as
the name suggests, returns the dot product of two vectors.

Which leads to the following simple program:

~~~~
use Math::Matrix;
say Math::Matrix:: -> new ([split ' ' => scalar <>]) -> dot_product
   (Math::Matrix:: -> new ([split ' ' => scalar <>]));
~~~~

### Scheme

Here we define a recursive function to calculate the dot product:

~~~~
(define (dotproduct a b)
    (if (null? a) 0
        (+ (* (car a) (car b))
              (dotproduct (cdr a) (cdr b)))))
~~~~

This defines a method `dotproduct` which takes arguments `a` and `b`,
which we assume are lists of equal length. Lists in Scheme are
implemented as (nested)
[*pairs*](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Pairs.html).
`car` gets the first element of a pair -- so the first element of a list.
`cdr` gets the second element of a pair, hence, all but the first element
of a list. So, `dotproduct` first checks the length of this: if the list
is empty (`null?`), we return `0`. Else, we multiply the first elements
of the input lists, and add this to the recursive call to `dotproduct`
with the remainders (`cdr`) of the input lists.

We read input using `read-line`, which we split on spaces (`string-split`),
and convert the results to numbers using `string->number`. This gives
the following code:

~~~~
(display (dotproduct (map string->number (string-split (read-line) #\ ))
                     (map string->number (string-split (read-line) #\ ))))
(newline)
~~~~

### Python

Here, we use simple iteration over lists to calculate the wanted
result. First, we use [*list comprehension*][list] to read the input,
and turn it in into lists of integers:

~~~~
a = [int (x) for x in input () . split (" ")]
b = [int (x) for x in input () . split (" ")]
~~~~

Now it's a simple loop:

~~~~
sum = 0
for i in range (len (a)):
    sum = sum + a [i] * b [i]

print (sum)
~~~~

### R

R actually *has* an operator to calculate the dot product (`%*%`). 
`readLines` read input, `strsplit` splits a string, while
`as.numeric` transforms strings into numbers. This gives us the
following compact program:

~~~~
stdin <- file ('stdin', 'r')

cat (as.numeric (strsplit (readLines (stdin, n = 1), " ") [[1]]) %*%
     as.numeric (strsplit (readLines (stdin, n = 1), " ") [[1]]), "\n")
~~~~

### Pascal

In our Pascal solution, we first read all the integers from the input,
putting them all in a single array:

~~~~
var
    n, size, j, half, sum: integer;
    numbers: array of integer;

begin
    size := 0;
    while not eof do begin
        read (n);
        inc (size);
        setlength (numbers, size);
        numbers [size - 1] := n;
    end;
~~~~

We then calculate the dot product by treating the first half of the array
as the first vector, and the second half of the array as the second 
vector:

~~~~
    sum := 0;
    half := (size - 1) div 2;
    for j := 0 to half do begin
        sum := sum + numbers [j] * numbers [half + j];
    end;

    writeln (sum);
end.
