# Perl Weekly Challenge 108: Locate Memory

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-108/#TASK1)

> Write a script to declare a variable or constant and print its
> location in the memory.


## Solution
This is a challenge which can only be solved in some languages.
Many, if not most, hide the actual memory locations from the user.

### Perl
There's not much to it. The
[`\`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlop#Symbolic-Unary-Operators) operator returns
a reference to its argument. And a reference in numeric context 
is the memory location of the reference.

say+0+\+0
~~~~

Since `+0` is a constant, `\+0` is a reference to it. If its an argument
of the addition operator (`+`), it's put in numeric context, and we get
memory address.
Adding `+0` to it is a no-op. So `+0+\+0` is the memory address of
the constant `+0`. Which we print with [`say`](#).

### C

In C, the `&` operator returns a pointer to its argument; and a 
pointer is basically a memory location. We can print this straight
away using the `%p` specifier for [`printf`](#3), however, this
would print the address in hex format.

To use the same format as the output for our solutions in different
languages, we cast the pointer to a `long long`, and print this.

~~~~
int main (void) {
    int i;
    printf ("%lld\n", (long long) &i);
    return (0);
}
