# Perl Weekly Challenge 150: Square-free Integer

## [Challenge][task2]
>>>>
Write a script to generate all square-free integers <= 500.

>>>>
In mathematics, a square-free integer (or squarefree integer) is
an integer which is divisible by no perfect square other than 1.
That is, its prime factorization has exactly one factor for each
prime that appears in it. For example, \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\) is
square-free, but \(18 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3\) is not, because 18 is
divisible by \(9 = 3^2\).

### Example

~~~~
The smallest positive square-free integers are
    1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, ...

## Discussion

This is sequence [A005117](#oeis) in
[The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org).
We want the first 306 terms.

We could take each of the numbers \(1 \leq n \leq 500\), calculate the factors
and check whether there are no duplicates. But that does more work
than we need to do. Instead, we look at squares of all the primes
\(p, 1 < p \leq \sqrt{500}\). If any of those divides a number \(n\),
\(n\) is not square-free. Else, it is.

There are only 8 such primes, as \(361 = 19^2 < 500 < 23^2 = 529\).

## Solutions

### Perl

After setting `$,`, this is just a one-liner:

~~~~
say grep {$a = $_; 8 == grep {$a % $_ ** 2} 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19} 1 .. 500

### Go

Explicit loops in Go:

~~~~
func main () {
    primes := [8] int {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19}
    for n := 1; n <= 500; n ++ {
        s := false
        for _, p := range primes {
            if (n % (p * p) == 0) {
                s = true
                break
            }
        }
        if !s {
            fmt . Printf ("%d ", n)
        }
    }
    fmt . Printf ("\n")
}
