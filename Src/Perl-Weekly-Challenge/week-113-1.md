# Perl Weekly Challenge: Represent Integer

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-113/#TASK1)

> You are given a positive integer `$N` and a digit `$D`.
>
> Write a script to check if `$N` can be represented as a sum of positive
> integers having `$D` at least once. If check passes print `1` otherwise `0`.

### Example

>     Input: $N = 25, $D = 7
>     Output: 0 as there are 2 numbers between 1 and 25 having the digit 7
>             i.e. 7 and 17. If we add up both we don't get 25.
>
>     Input: $N = 24, $D = 7
>     Output: 1

## Discussion

We could solve this by recursion and brute force trying to find a set
of numbers which to the given target number. Which will work
for the baby examples with tiny, tiny numbers typical of the
Perl Weekly Challenge, but would be absolutely madness for larger
numbers.

Instead we will first prove that most numbers can be written
as a sum of integers each containing a specific digit, and then
we will prove which of the remaining numbers can.

!definition
A positive integer containing a digit \(d\) is called a \(d\)-number.
!/definition

!definition
A positive integer which can be written as a sum of \(d\)-numbers
is called a \(d\)-composable number.
!/definition

!lemma
\(N\) is \(d\)-composable if
\[N \geq \begin{cases} 100, & d = 0 \\\\
                       d \cdot 10, & d \geq 1 \end{cases} \]

!/lemma

!proof
Let's first consider the case that \(d = 0\). If \(N \geq 100\)
then we can write \(N = 100 + i + k \cdot 10\), 
with \(i = N \mod 10\), and \(k = \frac{N - 100 - i}{10}\).

This means we can write \(N = (100 + i) + 10 + \ldots + 10\),
where we have a \(10\) \(k\) times. Since \(0 \leq i < 10\), \(100 + i\)
contains a \(0\), and so does \(10\). Hence, any \(N \geq 100\)
is \(0\)-composable.

If \(d > 0\) and \(N \geq 10 \cdot d\), then we can write
\(N = 10 \cdot d + i + k \cdot d\), with \(i = N \mod d\), and
\(k = \frac{N - 10 \cdot d - i}{d}\). 

This means we can write \(N = (10 \cdot d + i) + d + \ldots + d\),
where we have a \(d\) \(k\) times. Since \(0 \leq i < d\),
\(10 \cdot d + i\) is a two digit number starting with a \(d\).
Hence, any \(N \geq 10 \cdot d\) is \(d\)-composable.
!/proof

!lemma
\(N < 100\) is \(0\)-composable iff \(N\) is a multiple of \(10\).
!/lemma

!proof
All the \(0\)-numbers less than \(100\) are multiples of \(10\).
!/proof

!lemma
For \(d > 0\), \(N < 10 \cdot d\) is \(d\)-composable, iff
\(N = 10 \cdot c + d \cdot k\), for some
\(0 \leq c < \frac{d}{\text{gcd}(d, 10)}\).
!/lemma

!proof
Let \(g = \frac{d}{\text{gcd}(d, 10)}\).

If \(N < 10 \cdot d\), then \(N\) has at most two digits.
It follows from the definition that if \(N\) is \(d\)-composable, then
\[N = \sum_{i = 0}^{d-1} a_i \cdot (10 \cdot i + d) =
      10 \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{d-1} (a_i \cdot i) +
      d  \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{d-1} a_i
      \]

Let \(c' = \sum_{i = 0}^{d-1} (a_i \cdot i)\) and
\(k' = \sum_{i = 0}^{d-1} a_i\), hence, \(N = 10 \cdot c' + d \cdot k'\),
for some integers \(0 \leq c' < d, 0 < k'\).

Now, \(c' = c'' + b \cdot g\) so
that \(c'' < g\) (it's possible that \(b = 0\)). Hence,
\(N = 10 \cdot c'' + 10 \cdot b \cdot g + d \cdot k'\). Since
\(g = \frac{d}{\text{gcd}(d, 10)}\), \(10 \cdot g\) is a multiple of \(d\).
So, \(10 \cdot g = d \cdot k''\) for some integer \(k'' \geq 0\).
Plugging this in, we get \(N = 10 \cdot c'' + d \cdot (k' + b \cdot k'')\).
Since \(k' > 0\), we have \(N = (10 \cdot c'' + d) + d + \ldots + d\), where
the number of \(d\)s is \(k' - 1 + b \cdot k''\).
\(10 \cdot c'' + d\) is a one or two digit number containing a \(d\).

Picking \(c = c''\) and \(k = k' + b \cdot k''\) proofs our claim.
!/proof

## Solution

Given the lemmas above, we come to the following algorithm:

* If `$D == 0`, we output `1` if `$N >= 100` or `$N % 10 == 0`, and
  `0` otherwise.
* If `$D > 0`, then:
    * If `$N >= 10 * $D`, we output `1`, else
    * We iterate `$i` from `0` up to (but not including) the
      [greatest common divisor](#wiki) of `$D` and `10`:
        * If `($N - 10 * $i - $D)` is not negative, and a multiple
          of `$D`, we output `1`, and exit the loop.
    * If we did not produce any output, we output `0`.

We will use an predefined array with the greatest common divisors of
`10` and the numbers `1` to `9`; those values are: `1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1`.

### Perl

Predefined array with greatest common divisors:
~~~~
my @gcds = (0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 1);
~~~~

Reading the data:
~~~~
my ($N, $D) = split;
~~~~

Handling the case of `$D == 0`:
~~~~
if ($D == 0) {
    say $N >= 100 || $N % 10 == 0 ? 1 : 0;
    exit;
}
~~~~

Handling the case where `$N >= 10 * $D`:
~~~~
if ($N >= $D * 10) {
    say 1;
    exit;
}
~~~~

The other cases:
~~~~
for (my $i = 0; $i < $D / $gcds [$D]; $i ++) {
    my $T = $N - 10 * $i - $D;
    if ($T >= 0 && $T % $D == 0) {
        say 1;
        exit;
    }
}
say 0;
~~~~
