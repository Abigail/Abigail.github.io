# Perl Weekly Challenge: Represent Integer

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-113/#TASK1)

> You are given a positive integer `$N` and a digit `$D`.
>
> Write a script to check if `$N` can be represented as a sum of positive
> integers having `$D` at least once. If check passes print `1` otherwise `0`.

### Example

>     Input: $N = 25, $D = 7
>     Output: 0 as there are 2 numbers between 1 and 25 having the digit 7
>             i.e. 7 and 17. If we add up both we don't get 25.
>
>     Input: $N = 24, $D = 7
>     Output: 1

## Discussion

We could solve this by recursion and brute force trying to find a set
of numbers which to the given target number. Which will work
for the baby examples with tiny, tiny numbers typical of the
Perl Weekly Challenge, but would be absolutely madness for larger
numbers.

Instead we will first prove that most numbers can be written
as a sum of integers each containing a specific digit, and then
we will prove which of the remaining numbers can.

!definition
A number containing a digit \(d\) is called a \(d\)-number.
