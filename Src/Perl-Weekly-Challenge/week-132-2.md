# Perl Weekly Challenge 132: Hash Join

## [Challenge][task2]
>>>>
Write a script to implement Hash Join algorithm as suggested by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_join#Classic_hash_join">wikipedia</a>.

~~~~
1. For each tuple r in the build input R
   1.1 Add r to the in-memory hash table
   1.2 If the size of the hash table equals the maximum in-memory size:
       1.2.1 Scan the probe input S, and add matching join tuples to the
             output relation
       1.2.2 Reset the hash table, and continue scanning the build input R
2. Do a final scan of the probe input S and add the resulting join tuples
   to the output relation

Input:

@player_ages = (
        [20, &quot;Alex&quot;  ],
        [28, &quot;Joe&quot;   ],
        [38, &quot;Mike&quot;  ],
        [18, &quot;Alex&quot;  ],
        [25, &quot;David&quot; ],
        [18, &quot;Simon&quot; ],
    );

@player_names = (
        [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Stewart&quot;],
        [&quot;Joe&quot;,  &quot;Root&quot;   ],
        [&quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;Gatting&quot;],
        [&quot;Joe&quot;,  &quot;Blog&quot;   ],
        [&quot;Alex&quot;, &quot;Jones&quot;  ],
        [&quot;Simon&quot;,&quot;Duane&quot;  ],
    );

Output:

Based on index = 1 of @players_age and index = 0 of @players_name.

20, "Alex",  "Stewart"
20, "Alex",  "Jones"
18, "Alex",  "Stewart"
18, "Alex",  "Jones"
28, "Joe",   "Root"
28, "Joe",   "Blog"
38, "Mike",  "Gatting"
18, "Simon", "Duane"

## Discussion

Mapping instructions for a relation database to a language like Perl is
never easy. But these instructions are particular tricky, mostly because
of this:

>>>>
If the size of the hash table equals the maximum in-memory size
<<<<

In Perl, when you reach the maximum in-memory size, you have consumed
all the memory the OS is willing to give you. Perls solution to a request
for more memory if the OS isn't willing to give you more is to crash
(which cannot be trapped).
You will not have any memory left to do something useful.

Note that dealing with running out of memory is part of the challenge.
We're not asked to implement the standard hash join algorithm. Right
above the quoted algorithm, Wikipedia writes:

>>>>
This algorithm is simple, but it requires that the smaller join
relation fits into memory, which is sometimes not the case.
A simple approach to handling this situation proceeds as follows:
<<<<

So we really do have to create an algorithm which deals with running
out of memory. (And this begs the question "which piss poor hardware
is the weekly challenge running that such a small example runs out
of memory?").

Now, there is a way out of this. If you building perl with the 
`-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK` compilation option, and if you are building
perl so it uses its own malloc (which it doesn't do by default on most
platforms), then you can allocate some emergy memory using `$^M`.

This gives us a trappeble "running out of memory" event, but it's very
unlikely the program will be left in a state we can continue. So, whatever
algorithm we come up with, it will be extremely flimsy, and unlikely
to work. Given that, what is presented below is untested; we could not
be bothered to recompile perl.

## Solution

### Perl

First, we check whether the program is run by a perl which can actually
trap an out of memory event. If not, that's it. Else, we allocate some
emergency memory. (We're using 1 Mb of emergy memory. No idea whether
that is realistic or not).

~~~~
use Config;
use List::Util 'max';

BEGIN {
    die "No hash join for you -- recompile first!\n" unless
        $Config::Config {malloc_cflags} =~ /-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK\b/ &&
        $Config::Config {usemymalloc} eq 'y';

    $^M = " " x (1 << 20);  # 1 Mb.
}

my @R = ...;  # @player_ages in the example
my @S = ...;  # @player_names in the example

my $idx_R_njk = 0;
my $idx_R_jk  = 1;
my $idx_S_jk  = 0;
my $idx_S_njk = 1;
~~~~

We now create a `__DIE__` handler, to trap an out of memory event.
In that case, we call a subroutine called `flush`.

~~~~
my %output;
$SIG {__DIE__} = sub {
    if ("@_" =~ /Out of memory/) {
        flush (\@S, $idx_S_jk, \%output)
    }
    else {
        die @_;  # Propagate
    }
};
~~~~

The main loop of the program populates the output structure `%output`.
This implements step `1.1` of the algorithm. The hash `%output` uses
the ages as keys; each value is an array of first names.

~~~~
foreach my $r (@R) {
    push @{$output {$$r [$idx_R_jk]}} => $$r [$idx_R_njk];
}
~~~~

If we are running out of memory, `flush` is called. It processes the
`%output` structure, and sends results to standard output. To get the
memory needed, we undefine `$^M`, do our thing, release the memory
used by `%output`, and set `$^M` again. This implements step `1.2`
of the algorithm above.

~~~~
sub flush ($S, $idx_S_jk, $output) {
    undef $^M;  # Release memory.

    # 
    # Scan $S. For each match in $output, output a line.
    #
    foreach my $entry (@$S) {
        if ($$output {$$entry [$idx_S_jk]}) {
            for (my $i = 0; $i < @{$$output {$$entry [$idx_S_jk]}}; $i ++) {
                printf qq [%2d, %-${max_width}s "%s"\n],
                                 $$output {$$entry [$idx_S_jk]} [$i],
                           '"' . $$entry [$idx_S_jk] . '",',
                                 $$entry [$idx_S_njk];
            }
        }
    }

    %$output = ();  # Reset output table
 
    $^M = " " x (1 << 20); # Claim emergy memory again
} 
~~~~

As a final step, after the main loop, we have to call `flush` again.
This is step `2` of the algorithm above:

~~~~
flush (\@S, $idx_S_jk, \%output);
~~~~
