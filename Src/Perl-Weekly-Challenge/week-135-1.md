## Solution

We need to do a couple of things, all fairly trivial:

1. Read a line from standard input.
2. Remove a leading sign, as we can basically ignore it.
3. Check we're left with only digits; error if not.
4. Check we have an odd number of digits; error if not.
5. Check we have at least three digits; error if not.
6. Extract the middle three digits, and print them.

The third step technically isn't required, as it's a given we're getting
an integer. But we check anyway.

Note that a two digit integer fails validation twice: it's too short,
and it has an even number of digits. The fourth example shows we should
give an error for the second failure (and not the first).

As usual, we will be accepting multiple integers, assuming one
integer per line of input. For each integer, we'll print the
middle three digits, or an error if necessary.

### AWK

AWK is very suitable to repeatedly do something to a line of input,
and to repeat this for each line of input.

We start off with stripping a leading sign, if any:

~~~~
/^[-+]/         {$0 = substr ($0, 2)}
~~~~

`$0` holds the current line of input, and it's an lvalue, so we can
assign to it.

We can now do the validation. If it fails a validation, we print an
error message, and continue with the next line of input:

~~~~
/[^0-9]/        {print "not an integer";        next}
/^(..)*$/       {print "even number of digits"; next}
length ($0) < 3 {print "too short";             next}
~~~~

We can now print the middle three digits:

~~~~
{print substr ($0, 1 + (length ($0) - 3) / 2, 3)}
~~~~

[`substr`](#) in AWK takes three arguments: the string we want to
extract a substring from; the position from where to start (first
character is on position 1), and the length of the substring.

### Bash

We first start off reading a line of input using [`read`](#):

~~~~
while read line; do
~~~~

First, we strip off a leading sign, if any, using
[parameter expansion](#Shell-Parameter-Expansion):

~~~~
line=${line/#[-+]/}
~~~~

This takes what is in the variable `line`, and performs a substitution:
replacing `#[-+]` with nothing (because there is nothing following
the second slash. Where most languages use `^` to indicate the
beginning of a string, here, this role is played by `#`.

We now check whether we are left with just digits:

~~~~
if [[ $line =~ [^0-9] ]]
then echo "not an integer"
~~~~

[`[[`](#Bash-Conditional-Expressions) introduces *Bash Conditional
Expressions*. The expression results in a true/false result. Here,
we are matching `line` against a regular expression. Note that we
don't need a delimiter here.

Checking for the right amount of digits:

~~~~
elif ((${#line} % 2 == 0))
then echo "even number of digits"
elif ((${#line} < 3))
then echo "too short"
~~~~

[`((`](#Shell-Arithmetic) introduces *Shell Arithmetic*.

If we have passed all validations, we can print the right substring:

~~~~
echo ${line:$(((${#line} - 3) / 2)):3}
~~~~

We do this with several other
[parameter expansions](#Shell-Parameter-Expansion).

`${#line}` is the first parameter expansion. The result is the length
of the string in `line`.

`$(((${#line} - 3) / 2))` takes what is inside `$(( ))` and treats
it as an arithmetic expression. The result is the start index of
substring we want.

We use another type of parameter expansion to get the substring:
`${line:position:length}` gets `length` characters from `line`,
starting at position `position`.

FULL_PROGRAM

### C

We start off with reading a line from standard input. [`getline`](#)
will do the job:

~~~~
char *  line    = NULL;
size_t  len     = 0;
size_t  str_len;
while ((str_len = getline (&line, &len, stdin)) != -1) {
~~~~

The string (with terminating newline) will be put into the character
array `line`, while the return value of `getline` is the length
of the line. (`getline` will do the [`malloc`](#)ing for us, and
populate `len` with the number of bytes allocated; we will not
use `len` in our program).

We start with removing a leading sign, if any (if there is any
space following the sign, we will remove this as well):

~~~~
char * line_ptr = line;
if (* line_ptr == '-' || * line_ptr == '+') {
    str_len --;
    line_ptr ++;
    while (isspace (* line_ptr)) {
        line_ptr ++;
        str_len --;
    }
}
~~~~

The result is that afterwards, `line_ptr` will point to the first
character following the sign. 

Next step is to make sure all the other characters are digits.
Note that our string still contains a newline:

~~~~
bool done = false;
char * line_ptr2 = line_ptr;
while (* line_ptr2 && * line_ptr2 != '\n') {
    if (!isdigit (* line_ptr2)) {
        printf ("not an integer\n");
        done = true;
        break;
    }
    line_ptr2 ++;
}
if (done) {
    continue;
}
~~~~

C cannot break out of nested loops, so we determine the input
contains a non-digit, we set a boolean, and do the 
`continue` after we're done with the inner loop.

We can now check we have the right amount of digits (while
remembering we have a trailing newline):

~~~~
if (str_len % 2 == 1) {
    printf ("even number of digits\n");
    continue;
}

if (str_len < 4) {
    printf ("too short\n");
    continue;
}
~~~~

We can print the middle three digits, which we print one by one,
followed by a newline:

~~~~
size_t mid = (str_len - 3) / 2;
for (size_t i = 0; i < 3; i ++) {
    printf ("%c", line_ptr [mid + i]);
}
printf ("\n");
~~~~

It's C, so, we shouldn't forget the [`free`](#) allocated
memory:

~~~~
free (line);
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Go

First, we have to read a line from standard input:

~~~~
    var reader = bufio . NewReader (os. Stdin)
main_loop:
    for {
        var text, err = reader . ReadString ('\n')
        if (err != nil) {
            break
        }
~~~~

Stripping off the newline we do with [`TrimRight`](#) in the `string`
module:

~~~~
text = strings . TrimRight (text, "\n")
~~~~

Go has immutable strings, so we have a leading sign, we take a
[*slice*](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro)
from the string, and assign that back to the string:

~~~~
if (text [0:1] == "-" || text [0:1] == "+") {
    text = text [1:]
}
~~~~

We now check whether the string contains just digits. For that,
we iterate over the [*runes*](https://go.dev/blog/strings) of the string:

~~~~
for _, rune := range text {
    if rune < '0' || rune > '9' {
        fmt . Print ("not an integer\n")
        continue main_loop
    }
}
~~~~

We can now check for the correct number of digits. 
[`len`](#) returns the length of a string:

~~~~
if len (text) % 2 == 0 {
    fmt . Print ("even number of digits\n")
    continue main_loop
}

if len (text) < 3 {
    fmt . Print ("too short\n")
    continue main_loop
}
~~~~

Now we can print the required digits, using a slice:

~~~~
fmt . Printf ("%s\n", text [(len (text) - 3) / 2 :
                            (len (text) + 3) / 2])
~~~~

### Java

Java requires even more work to be done to just read a line of input:

~~~~
Scanner scanner = new Scanner (System . in);
try {
    while (true) {
        String line = scanner . nextLine ();
~~~~

This time, we first check whether we have an integer, by using a regular
expression. The
[`matches`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#matches(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.CharSequence))
function in the `Pattern` class
tries to match the given pattern against the given string:

~~~~
if (!Pattern . matches ("^[-+]?[0-9]+$", line)) {
    System . out . println ("not an integer");
    continue;
}
~~~~

If the string starts with a sign, we get rid of it. Java strings
are immutable, so we take a substring and assign it back to the
string:

~~~~
if (Pattern . matches ("^[-+].*", line)) {
    line = line . substring (1);
}
~~~~

We can now check for the right amount of digits:

~~~~
int ll = line . length ();
if (ll % 2 == 0) {
    System . out . println ("even number of digits");
    continue;
}
if (ll < 3) {
    System . out . println ("too short");
    continue;
}
~~~~

Finally, we print the wanted digits:

~~~~
System . out . println (line . substring ((ll - 3) / 2,
                                         (ll + 3) / 2));
~~~~

### Lua

First, we strip off the sign. `line` contains
a line from standard input:

~~~~
line = line : gsub ("^[-+]%s*", "")
~~~~

Our set of validations:

~~~~
if line : find ("%D") then
    print ("not an integer")
else
    if line : len () % 2 == 0 then
        print ("even number of digits")
    else
        if line : len () < 3 then
            print ("too short")
~~~~

And the printing of the middle digits:

~~~~
local start = 1 + (line : len () - 3) / 2
print (line : sub (start, start + 2))
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Node.js

First, we strip off the sign and the trailing newline. `line` contains
a line from standard input:

~~~~
line . replace (/^[-+]/, '') . trim ()
~~~~

[`replace`](#) takes two arguments, a pattern, and a replacement,
while [`trim`](#) removes whitespace from either end of the string.
Neither method changes a string -- they return the modified string.

We now do the validations as a sequence of `if/else` statements:

~~~~
if (line . match (/[^0-9]/)) {
    console . log ("not an integer")
}
else {
    if (line . length % 2 == 0) {
        console . log ("even number of digits")
    }
    else {
        if (line . length < 3) {
            console . log ("too short")
        }
    }
}
~~~~

[`match`](#) takes a pattern as argument, and returns true if the
pattern matches the string it's applied to.

Finally, the printing:

~~~~
console . log (line . substr ((line . length - 3) / 2, 3))
~~~~

### Perl

Perl has powerful regexes: it has the ability to run code, and dynamically
create sub-patterns. 

We use this to validate the number, and select the middle digits at the
same time; if it fails, we do additional checks, all using regular expressions
to find out why it fails:

~~~~
say /^[-+]?([0-9]*)([0-9]{3})([0-9]*)$
    (??{length ($1) == length ($3) ? "" : "(*FAIL)"})/x
                              ? $2
  : /^[-+]?[0-9]*[^0-9].*\n/  ? "not an integer"
  : /^[-+]?(?:[0-9][0-9])*\n/ ? "even number of digits"
  :                             "too short"
~~~~

`$_` contains the line of input (with a trailing newline). The first
regular expression does the validation, and selecting of the middle
digits. We can break down the expression as follows:

~~~~
/^               # Match from the beginning
 [-+]?           # An optional sign
 ([0-9]*)        # Zero or more digits; capture group $1
 ([0-9]{3})      # Exactly three digits; capture group $2
 ([0-9]*)        # Zero or more digits; capture group $3
 $               # End of string
 (??{            # Run the following code, and treat its value
                 # as a sub-pattern to be matched at this point.
     length ($1) == length ($3)  # If capture groups $1 and $3 are same length:
             ? ""                # Match an empty string (always succeeds)
             : "(*FAIL)"         # Else fail (and backtrack)
 })/x
~~~~

The latter part, forcing that the first and third capture group
have the same number of digits, means that if the entire match
succeeds, `$2` contains the middle three digits: it must be the
middle three, as the entire number (without sign) is `$1$2$3`,
and `$1` and `$3` contain the same amount of digits.

If the match fails, we need to find out why it fails:

~~~~
/^[-+]?[0-9]*[^0-9].*\n/
~~~~

This pattern matches if the input line contains, except a leading sign
and trailing newline, a character which is not a digit.

~~~~
/^[-+]?(?:[0-9][0-9])*\n/ 
~~~~

This pattern matches if, and only if, the input line contains an even
number of digits (note that if we execute this pattern, we already know
all the characters between the beginning (and possible sign) and the
trailing newline are all digits.

If this last pattern fails as well, the only possibility which is left,
is that the input number contains less than three digits.

### Python

The Python solution follows the same strategy as most implementations.

First, we remove any leading sign, and the trailing newline. `line`
contains our line of input:

~~~~
line = re . sub (r'^[-+]', '', line . strip ())
~~~~

String are immutable in Python, so all the methods return the modified
string, without modifying the original. 

Validating and printing the middle three digits is easy:

~~~~
ll = len (line)
if re . search (r'[^0-9]', line):
    print ("not an integer")
elif ll % 2 == 0:
    print ("even number of digits")
elif ll < 3:
    print ("too short")
else:
    print (line [(ll - 3) // 2 : (ll + 3) // 2])
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Ruby

The Ruby solution looks very similar to the Python solution. The
current line of input is in the variable `line`:

~~~~
line = line . strip() . gsub(/^[-+]/, "")
ll   = line . length
if line . match (/[^0-9]/) then
    puts ("not an integer")
elsif ll % 2 == 0 then
    puts ("even number of digits")
elsif ll < 3 then
    puts ("too short")
else
    puts (line [((ll - 3) / 2) . to_i .. ((ll + 2) / 2) . to_i])
end
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Scheme

Our Scheme solution isn't very different from other solutions -- it just
*looks* different:

~~~~
(define line (read-line))
~~~~

This creates a variable `line`, and we initialize it with a line from
standard input.

We first check whether the input contains an integer, and we capture
the numbers:

~~~~
(set! is-number (string-match "^[-+]?([0-9]+)$" line))
~~~~

`string-match` takes two arguments, and matches the first argument
(the pattern) against the second argument. If the match succeeds,
a *match object* is returned; else, `#f` is returned.

We first check whether the match succeed; if it doesn't, we print
the appropriate message:

~~~~
(if (not is-number)
    (display "not an integer")
    ...
~~~~

If it does match, `not is-number` is fails, so the `if` statement executes
its third argument (represented by `...` above). This third argument is:

~~~~
(begin
    (set! number (match:substring is-number 1))
    (set! ll (string-length number))
    (if (= (modulo ll 2) 0)
        (display "even number of digits")
        (if (< ll 3)
            (display "too short")
            (display (substring number (/ (- ll 3) 2)
                                       (/ (+ ll 3) 2)))
        )
    )
)
~~~~

Remember the capture in the first pattern? The match object can be
queried for that using `match:substring`. This function takes the
arguments, a match object, and the number of the capture we want.
In our case, this is the number without sign.

`string-length` returns the length of its argument.

The rest of the code is fairly straightforward. Remember that in
scheme, all operators are postfix operators (and as such, there
isn't any difference between operators and functions).

FULL_PROGRAM

### Tcl

Our Tcl solution starts with:

~~~~
if {[regexp {^[-+]?([0-9]+)$} $line -> digits]} {
    ...
} else {
    puts "not an integer"
}
~~~~

where `$line` contains the current line of input. `regexp` takes
at least two parameters: a pattern, a value to match against.
Subsequent parameters, if any, are use to write captures to,
where the first capture is the entire match; each subsequent capture
is a next group of parens. Here `->` isn't a funny piece of syntax,
it is the third argument to `regexp`, indicating we don't need
the entire match. But we do want what was matched by the first set
of parens: this is written to the variable `digits`.

If the match fails, we're printing `not an integer`. Else, we run what's
in the placeholder `...`:

~~~~
set ll [string length $digits]
if {[expr $ll % 2] == 0} {
    puts "even number of digits"
} elseif {[expr $ll < 3]} {
    puts "too short"
} else {
    puts [string range $digits [expr ($ll - 3) / 2]\
                               [expr ($ll + 2) / 2]]
~~~~
