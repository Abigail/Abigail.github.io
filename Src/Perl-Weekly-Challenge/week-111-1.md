# Perl Weekly Challenge 111: Search Matrix

## [Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-111/#TASK1)

> You are given 5x5 matrix filled with integers such that each row is
> sorted from left to right and the first integer of each row is greater
> than the last integer of the previous row.
>
> Write a script to find a given integer in the matrix using an
> efficient search algorithm.

### Example

>     Matrix: [  1,  2,  3,  5,  7 ]
>             [  9, 11, 15, 19, 20 ]
>             [ 23, 24, 25, 29, 31 ]
>             [ 32, 33, 39, 40, 42 ]
>             [ 45, 47, 48, 49, 50 ]
> 
>     Input: 35
>     Output: 0 since it is missing in the matrix
> 
>     Input: 39
>     Output: 1 as it exists in the matrix

## Discussion

This challenge confuses me. We're basically asked to find a number
in a sorted list. Which in languages without hashes one would solve
with binary search (yielding an \(\mathcal{O} (\log N)\) solution),
and in languages with hashes you'd use a hash (yielding an \(\mathcal{O} (1)\)
(expected) time solution).
Sure, the hash takes linear preprocessing time, but since we're asked
to write a script, we're spending linear time reading in the data
anyway.

Perhaps the intend was a subroutine which takes a matrix and a target
number, but that was not what is being asked. The challenge explicitly
asks for *a script*, which means we have to spend a linear amount of
time reading data anyway. So, that's what you get.

The only part where we use the fact we are given a matrix is for the
input: the first five lines are assumed to contain the matrix. The
rest of the input is taken as numbers to search for.

Only for language lacking hashes/maps/dictionaries/tables, we will
make use of the fact the input is sorted. For the majority of
languages, the fact input is sorted does not offer additional benefits.

## Solutions

All the solutions first read the matrix (five rows with five integers,
separated by white space) from standard input. The rest of the input
is taken as numbers to search for -- one integer per line.

### Perl

For our Perl solution, we offer two ways to solve this.

First is a simple hash based solution:
~~~~
my $MATRIX_SIZE = 5;
my %matrix;
@matrix {<> =~ /-?[0-9]+/g} = () for 1 .. $MATRIX_SIZE;

chomp, say exists $matrix {$_} || 0 while <>;
~~~~
Here, we read in five lines of data, which we store in a hash.
Then for the rest of the input, we print `1` or `0` depending
on whether the number is in the matrix or not.

Our second solution has a subroutine which takes two arguments:
a 5 x 5 matrix (a reference to a two dimensional array), and 
a number to search for. We're using a bog standard binary search
to find the number. Binary search uses a one dimensional structure
to search, but we can trivially map a one dimensional coordinate to
a two dimensional one by using integer division, and the modulus operation.
~~~~
my sub bsearch ($matrix, $target) {
    my ($min, $max) = (0, $MATRIX_SIZE * $MATRIX_SIZE);
    while ($min < $max) {
        use integer;
        my $mid = ($min + $max) / 2;
        #
        # To map a 1-d coordinate c to a 2-d pair x, y, we use
        # x = floor (c / size), y = c % size.
        #
        my $cmp = $$matrix [$mid / $MATRIX_SIZE]
                           [$mid % $MATRIX_SIZE] <=> $target;
        if    ($cmp < 0) {$min = $mid + 1}
        elsif ($cmp > 0) {$max = $mid}
        else  {return 1}
    }
    return (0)
}

### AWK

In AWK, arrays are associative, taking both integers and strings
as indices. As such, we can do \(\mathcal{O} (1)\) (expected) time
lookups. 

By default, AWK splits input lines on white space, which makes
reading in the data easy. First five (`$MATRIX_SIZE`) lines are
the matrix to search in:
~~~~
NR <= MATRIX_SIZE {
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i ++) {
        matrix [$i] = 1
    }
}
~~~~
The rest of the input are numbers to search for:
~~~~
NR > MATRIX_SIZE {
    print (matrix [$0] ? 1 : 0)
}
~~~~

### Bash

Bash also has associative arrays, which we can declare by using the
`-A` option to [`declare`](#Bash-Builtins).

We can then read in five (`$MATRIX_SIZE`) lines of data. Using 
[`read`](#Bash-Builtins) with the `-a` option reads a line from
standard input, splits it on white space, and places the fields
in an array (called `line` in our case). We then add place each
field in the associative array `matrix`:
~~~~
declare -A matrix
MATRIX_SIZE=5
for   ((i = 1; i <= $MATRIX_SIZE; i ++))
do    read -a line
      for n in ${line[@]}
      do  matrix[$n]=1
      done
done
~~~~

We can now read the rest of the input, and print whether or not
the read element is in the matrix:
~~~~
while read number
do    echo $((matrix[$number] ? 1 : 0))
done
~~~~

### C
C does not have native support for hashes or associative arrays.
So, for our C solution, we will make use of binary search -- which
is supported by the standard library.

First order of business is to read 25 integers into an array named
`matrix`:
~~~~
# define MATRIX_SIZE 5
# define NR_OF_ELEMENTS (MATRIX_SIZE * MATRIX_SIZE)

int * matrix;

if ((matrix = (int *) malloc (NR_OF_ELEMENTS * sizeof (int))) == NULL) {
    perror ("Malloc failed");
    exit (1);
}

/*
 * Read in the matrix
 */
for (int i = 0; i < NR_OF_ELEMENTS; i ++) {
    if (scanf ("%d", &matrix [i]) != 1) {
        perror ("Scanf failed");
        exit (1);
    }
}
~~~~
We will do the binary search by making use of the [`bsearch`](#3)
library call. It does need a comparison function, which takes
two arguments and which returns a negative value if the first
argument is less than the second, zero if the arguments are equal,
and positive if the first argument is larger than the second.
This is the function we will be using:
~~~~
static int compare (const void * a, const void * b) {
    return * (int *) a - * (int *) b;
}
~~~~
We're now ready to search for the values:
~~~~
int target;
while (scanf ("%d", &target) == 1) {
    printf ("%d\n", bsearch (&target, matrix, NR_OF_ELEMENTS,
                              sizeof (int), compare) == NULL ? 0 : 1);
}
~~~~

### Lua
Lua has tables, which work like associative arrays. It has also a
feature to read a number from standard input: `read ("*number")`,
which is quite handy for this challenge:

~~~~
local MATRIX_SIZE = 5

local matrix = {}

-- 
-- Read in the matrix
--
for i = 1, MATRIX_SIZE * MATRIX_SIZE do 
    matrix [io . read ("*number")] = 1
end

--
-- Read in the rest, printing 1/0 depending on
-- whether the number is present in the matrix or not.
--
while true do
    local target = io . read ("*number")
    if   target == nil then break end
    if   matrix [target]
    then print (1)
    else print (0)
    end
end
~~~~

FULL_PROGRAM

### Node.js
In Node.js, we first slurp in the entire input, and extract the numbers:
~~~~
let MATRIX_SIZE = 5

let numbers = 
  require      ("fs")
. readFileSync (0)                     // Read all.
. toString     ()                      // Turn it into a string.
. match        (/-?[0-9]+/g)
~~~~

Then we create the matrix structure:
~~~~
let matrix = {}
for (let i = 0; i < MATRIX_SIZE * MATRIX_SIZE; i ++) {
    matrix [numbers [i]] = 1
}
~~~~

Now we can check the rest of the numbers if they are present:
~~~~
for (let j = MATRIX_SIZE * MATRIX_SIZE; j < numbers . length; j ++) {
    console . log (matrix [numbers [j]] ? 1 : 0)
}
~~~~

### Pascal
For our Pascal solution, we make use of Binary Search. We start off
with defining a `bsearch` method, which takes a matrix (an array of
integers), and a number to search with as arguments, and which returns
`1` or `0` depending on whether the number is present or not.
~~~~
const
    matrix_size = 5;

type
    matrix_type = Array [1 .. matrix_size * matrix_size] of Longint;

function bsearch (matrix: matrix_type; target: Longint) : Integer;
    var
        min, mid, max: Integer;
    begin
        bsearch := 0; 
        min     := 1;
        max     := matrix_size * matrix_size + 1;
        while min < max do
        begin
            mid := (min + max) div 2;
            if matrix [mid] = target then
            begin   
                bsearch := 1;
                min     := max;
            end;
            if matrix [mid] < target then
            begin
                min     := mid + 1;
            end
            else begin  
                max     := mid;
            end
        end
    end;
~~~~
Reading in the data, and calling the `bsearch` function:
~~~~
begin
    (* Read in the matrix *)
    for i := 1 to matrix_size * matrix_size do
    begin
        read (matrix [i]);
    end;
        
    (* The rest of the input are numbers we want to search *)
    while not eof () do
    begin
        readln  (target);
        writeln (bsearch (matrix, target));
    end;
end.
