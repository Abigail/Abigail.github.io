# Advent Of Code 2023

Every year (since 2015) [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) offers
a set of programming challenges in the month of December. One two
part puzzle each day, starting on the first of December, finishing
on Christmas Day.

In this set of blog posts, we discuss how we solved each day puzzle.

Some people try to solve the puzzle fast, in an attempt to reach
[*the leaderboard*](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard). That
is not something that I aspire. If only because the puzzles become
available at 06:00 my time, and I usually do not stay up that late.

I also do not write two programs. I start by writing a program to
solve the first part, then, when solved and the second part is resolved,
I modify the program to solve part two. This often involves rewriting
how I solved the first part. I prefer solutions which only need to 
pass over the input once; no separate passes for each part (but there
can of course be exceptions).

I strive to make my solutions clean, readible and concise. And generic,
that is, they ought to work on any input which satisfies the given problem;
I don't like programs which don't consider cases "because they didn't occur
in my given input".
